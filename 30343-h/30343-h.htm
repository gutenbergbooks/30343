<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>Between 1710 and 1729 Anthony Collins was lampooned, satirized, and
gravely denounced from pulpit and press as England&#8217;s most insidious
defiler of church and state. Yet within a year of his death he became the
model of a proper country gentleman,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>... he had an opulent Fortune, descended to him from his Ancestors,
which he left behind him unimpair&#8217;d: He lived on his own Estate in
the Country, where his Tenants paid him moderate Rents, which he
never enhanced on their making any Improvements; he always oblig&#8217;d
his Family to a constant attendance on Publick Worship; as he was
himself a Man of the strictest Morality, for he never suffer&#8217;d any
Body about him who was deficient in that Point; he exercised a
universal Charity to all Sorts of People, without any Regard either
to Sect or Party; being in the Commission of the Peace, he
<ins class="correction" title="original reads 'administred'">administered</ins> Justice with such Impartiality and Incorruptness, that
the most distant Part of the County flock&#8217;d to his Decisions; but the
chief Use he made of his Authority was in accommodating
Differences;...<small><a name="f1.1" id="f1.1" href="#f1">[1]</a></small></p></div>

<p>In a comparison which likens him to Sir Roger de Coverley, there is less
truth than fiction. What they did share was a love of the countryside and
a &#8220;universal Charity&#8221; towards its inhabitants. For the most part, however,
we can approximate Collins&#8217;s personality by reversing many of Sir Roger&#8217;s
traits. Often at war with his world, as the spectatorial character was
not, he managed to maintain an intellectual rapport with it and even with
those who sought his humiliation. He never&mdash;as an instance&mdash;disguised his
philosophical distrust of Samuel Clarke; yet during any debate he planned
&#8220;most certainly [to] outdo him in civility and good manners.&#8221;<small><a name="f2.1" id="f2.1" href="#f2">[2]</a></small> This
decorum in no way compromised his pursuit of what he considered objective
truth or his denunciation of all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span> &#8220;methods&#8221; or impositions of spiritual
tyranny. Thus, during the virulent, uneven battle which followed upon the
publication of the <i>Discourse of Free-Thinking</i>, he ignored his own wounds
in order to applaud a critic&#8217;s</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>suspicions that there is a sophism</i> in what he calls my
<i>hypothesis</i>. That is a temper that ought to go thro&#8217; all our
Inquirys, and especially before we have an opportunity of examining
things to the bottom. It is safest at all times, and we are least
likely to be mistaken, if we constantly suspect our selves to be
under mistakes.... I have no system to defend or that I would seem to
defend, and am unconcerned for the consequence that may be drawn from
my opinion; and therefore stand clear of all difficultys w<sup>ch</sup> others
either by their opinion or caution are involved in.<small><a name="f3.1" id="f3.1" href="#f3">[3]</a></small></p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the statement of a man whose intellectual and religious commitment
makes him see that his own fallibility is symptomatic of a human tendency
to error. For himself, hence, he tries to avoid all manner of hard-voiced
enthusiasm. Paradoxically, however, Collins searched with a zealot&#8217;s
avidity for any controversy which would either assert his faith or test
his disbelief. When once he found his engagement, he revelled in it,
whether as the aggressor or the harassed defendant. For example, in the
&#8220;Preface&#8221; to the <i>Scheme of Literal Prophecy Considered</i> he boastfully
enumerated all the works&mdash;some twenty-nine&mdash;which had repudiated his
earlier <i>Discourse on the Grounds and Reasons of the Christian Religion</i>.
And in malicious fact he held up the publication of the <i>Scheme</i> for
almost a year that he might add a &#8220;Postscript to the Preface&#8221; in which he
identified six more pieces hostile to the <i>Grounds and Reasons</i>.<small><a name="f4.1" id="f4.1" href="#f4">[4]</a></small></p>

<p>By May of 1727 and with no visible sign of fatigue he took on a new
contender; this time it was John Rogers, canon in ordinary to the Prince
of Wales. At the height of their debate, in late summer, Collins made
practical enquiries about methods to prolong and intensify its
give-and-take. Thus, in a note to his friend Pierre Des Maizeaux, he said:
&#8220;But I would be particularly informed of the success and sale of the
Letter to D<sup>r</sup> Rogers;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span> because, if it could be, I would add to a new
edition thereof two or three as sheets; which also might be sold
separately to those who have already that Letter.&#8221; For all his militant
polemic, he asked only that his &#8220;Adversaries&#8221; observe with him a single
rule of fair play; namely, that they refrain from name-calling and petty
sniping. &#8220;Personal matters,&#8221; he asserted, &#8220;tho they may some times afford
useful remarks, are little regarded by Readers, who are very seldom
mistaken in judging that the most impertinent subject a man can talk of is
himself,&#8221; particularly when he inveighs against another.<small><a name="f5.1" id="f5.1" href="#f5">[5]</a></small></p>

<p>If Collins had been made to look back over the years 1676-1729, he
probably would have summarized the last twenty with a paraphrase of the
Popean line, &#8220;This long controversy, my life.&#8221; For several years and in
such works as <i>Priestcraft in Perfection</i> (1710) and <i>A Discourse of
Free-Thinking</i> (1713), he was a flailing polemicist against the entire
Anglican hierarchy. Not until 1724 did he become a polished debater, when
he initiated a controversy which for the next five years made a &#8220;very
great noise&#8221; and which ended only with his death. The loudest shot in the
persistent barrage was sounded by the <i>Grounds and Reasons</i>, and its last
fusillade by the <i>Discourse concerning Ridicule and Irony in Writing</i>.<small><a name="f6.1" id="f6.1" href="#f6">[6]</a></small></p>

<p>During those five years Collins concentrated upon a single opponent in
each work and made it a rhetorical practice to change his &#8220;Adversary&#8221; in
successive essays. He created in this way a composite victim whose
strength was lessened by deindividualization; in this way too he ran no
risk of being labelled a hobbyhorse rider or, more seriously, a
persecutor. Throughout the <i>Grounds and Reasons</i> he laughed at, reasoned
against, and satirized William Whiston&#8217;s assumption that messianic
prophecies in the Old Testament were literally fulfilled in the figure and
mission of Jesus. Within two years and in a new work, he substituted
Edward Chandler, Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, for the mathematician.
It need not have been the Bishop; any one of thirty-four others could have
qualified for the role of opponent, among them people like Clarke, and
Sykes, and Sherwood, and even the ubiquitous Whiston. Collins rejected
them, however, to debate in the <i>Scheme</i> with Bishop Chandler, the author
of <i>A Defence of Christianity from the Prophecies of the old Testament</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
with one who was, in short, the least controversial and yet the most
orthodox of his many assailants.</p>

<p>Early in 1727 the Anglican establishment came to the abrupt realization
that the subject of the continuing debate&mdash;the reliability of the argument
from prophecy&mdash;was inconclusive, that it could lead only to pedantic
wrangling and hair-splitting with each side vainly clutching victory.
Certainly the devotion of many clergymen to biblical criticism was
secondary to their interest in orthodoxy as a functional adjunct of
government, both civil and canonical. It was against this interest, as it
was enunciated in Rogers&#8217;s <i>Eight Sermons concerning the Necessity of
Revelation</i> (1727) and particularly in its vindictive preface, that
Collins chose to fight.<small><a name="f7.1" id="f7.1" href="#f7">[7]</a></small> The debate had now taken a happy turn for him.
As he saw it, the central issue devolved upon man&#8217;s natural right to
religious liberty. At least he made this the theme of his <i>Letter to Dr.
Rogers</i>. In writing to Des Maizeaux about the success of this work, he
obviously enjoyed his own profane irony:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I have had particular compliments made me by the B<sup>P</sup> of Salisbury,
and by D<sup>r</sup> Clark, who among other things sayd, that the Archbp of
Canterbury might have writ all that related to Toleration in it: to
say nothing of what I hear from others. D<sup>r</sup> Rogers himself has
acknowledg[ed] to his Bookseller who sent it to him into the Country,
that he has receivd it; but says that he is so engaged in other
affairs, that he has no thought at present of answering it; tho he
may perhaps in time do so.<small><a name="f8.1" id="f8.1" href="#f8">[8]</a></small></p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In time Rogers did. He counterattacked on 2 February 1728 with a
<i>Vindication of the Civil Establishment of Religion</i>.<small><a name="f9.1" id="f9.1" href="#f9">[9]</a></small> For Collins this
work was a dogged repetition of what had gone before, and so it could be
ignored except for one of its appendices, <i>A Letter from the Rev. Dr.
Marshall jun. To the Rev. Dr. Rogers, upon Occasion of his Preface to his
Eight Sermons</i>. Its inclusion seemed an afterthought; yet it altered the
dimensions of the debate by narrowing and particularizing the areas of
grievance which separated the debaters. Collins, therefore, rebutted it
some fourteen months later in <i>A Discourse concerning Ridicule and Irony</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
<i>in Writing</i>. He had great hopes for this pamphlet, preparing carefully for
its reception. He encouraged the republication of his three preceding
works, which find their inevitable conclusion, even their exoneration, in
this last performance, and he probably persuaded his bookseller to
undertake an elaborate promotional campaign. For the new editions were
advertised on seven different days between 10 January and 27 February 1729
in the <i>Daily Post</i>. He wanted no one to miss the relationship between the
<i>Discourse concerning Ridicule and Irony</i> and these earlier pieces or to
overlook its presence when it finally appeared in the pamphlet shops on 17
March.</p>

<p>Collins was animated by his many debates. Indeed, &#8220;he sought the storms.&#8221;
Otherwise he would not, could not, have participated in these many verbal
contests. Throughout them all, his basic strategy&mdash;that of
provocation&mdash;was determined by the very real fact that he had many more
enemies than allies, among them, for instance, such formidable antagonists
as Swift and Richard Bentley.<small><a name="f10.1" id="f10.1" href="#f10">[10]</a></small> To survive he had to acquire a tough
resilience, a skill in fending off attacks or turning them to his own
advantage. Nevertheless, he remained a ready target all his life.
Understandably so: his radicalism was stubborn and his opinions
predictable. Such firmness may of course indicate his aversion to
trimming. Or it may reveal a lack of intellectual growth; what he believed
as a young man, he perpetuated as a mature adult. Whether our answer is
drawn from either possibility or, more realistically, from both, the fact
remains that he never camouflaged the two principles by which he lived and
fought:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. That universal liberty be established in respect to opinions and
practises not prejudicial to the peace and welfare of society: by
which establishment, truth must needs have the advantages over
<i>error</i> and <i>falsehood</i>, the <i>law</i> of <i>God</i> over the <i>will</i> of <i>man</i>,
and <i>true Christianity tolerated</i>; private <i>judgment</i> would be really
exercised; and men would be allowed to have suffered to follow their
consciences, over which God only is supreme:...</p>

<p>2. Secondly, that nothing but the <i>law of nature</i>, (the observance
whereof is absolutely necessary to society)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span> and what can be built
thereon, should be enforced by the civil sanctions of the
magistrate:...<small><a name="f11.1" id="f11.1" href="#f11">[11]</a></small></p></div>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>There is very little in this statement to offend modern readers. Yet the
orthodox in Collins&#8217;s own time had reason to be angry with him: his
arguments were inflammatory and his rhetoric was devious, cheeky, and
effective. Those contesting him underscored his negativism, imaging him as
a destroyer of Christianity eager &#8220;to proselyte men, from the Christian to
no religion at all.&#8221;<small><a name="f12.1" id="f12.1" href="#f12">[12]</a></small> Certainly it is true that he aimed to disprove a
Christian revelation which he judged fraudulent and conspiratorial. In
place of ecclesiastical authority he offered the rule of conscience. For
<ins class="correction" title="original reads 'othodoxy'">orthodoxy</ins> he substituted &#8220;a Religion antecedent to Revelation, which is
necessary to be known in order to <i>ascertain Revelation</i>; and by that
Religion [he meant] <i>Natural Religion</i>, which is presupposed to
Revelation, and is a Test by which Reveal&#8217;d Religion is to be tried, is a
Bottom on which it must stand, and is a Rule to understand it by.&#8221;<small><a name="f13.1" id="f13.1" href="#f13">[13]</a></small>
Categorical in tone, the statement frustrated the Anglican clergy by its
very slipperiness; its generalities left little opportunity for decisive
rebuttal. It provided no definition of natural religion beyond the
predication of a body of unnamed moral law which is rational and original,
the archetype of what is valid in the world&#8217;s religions.</p>

<p>His dismissal of revelation and his reduction of Christianity to what he
called its &#8220;natural&#8221; and hence incontrovertible basis carried with it a
corollary, that of man&#8217;s absolute right to religious enquiry and
profession. Here he became specific, borrowing from Lockean empiricism his
conditions of intellectual assent. &#8220;Evidence,&#8221; he said, &#8220;ought to be the
sole ground of Assent, and Examination is the way to arrive at Evidence;
and therefore rather than I wou&#8217;d have Examination, Arguing and Objecting
laid aside, I wou&#8217;d chuse to say, That no Opinions whatever can be
dangerous to a Man that impartially examines into the Truth of
Things.&#8221;<small><a name="f14.1" id="f14.1" href="#f14">[14]</a></small> The church leadership saw in this statement and others like
it not an epistemological premise but a deliberate subterfuge, an
insidious blind to vindicate his attacks upon an organized priesthood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span> We
can recognize now that his opponents oversimplified his intention, that
they blackened it to make his villainy at once definitive and vulnerable.
At the same time we must admit that he often equated the ideas of
repression and clerical authority, even as he coupled those of freedom and
the guide of private conscience.</p>

<p>The Anglican church was infuriated by these correlations, angered as much
by their manner of expression as by their substance. For the faithful were
frequently thrown off balance by a strategy of ironical indirection.
Sometimes this took the form of omission or the presentation of an
argument in so fragmentary or slanted a fashion that Collins&#8217;s &#8220;Enemies&#8221;
could debate neither his implications nor his conclusions. At other times
he used this artful circumlocution to create his favorite mask, that of
the pious Christian devoted to scripture or of the moralist perplexed by
the divisions among the orthodox clergy. Finally, his rhetoric was shaped
by deistic predecessors who used sarcasm and satire to mock the gravity of
church authority. So much was their wit a trademark that as early as 1702
one commentator had noted, &#8220;when you expect an argument, they make a
jest.&#8221;<small><a name="f15.1" id="f15.1" href="#f15">[15]</a></small> Collins himself resorted to this practice with both instinctive
skill and deliberate contrivance.</p>

<p>All these methods, though underhanded, he silently justified on the
assumption that he was dealing with a conspiracy of priests: hence, he
professed that he had to fight fraud and deception with their like, and
that such craftiness, suitable &#8220;to his particular genius and temper,&#8221; was
&#8220;serviceable to his cause.&#8221; For these reasons even William Warburton, who
had vainly struggled to be judicious, described him as &#8220;a Writer, whose
dexterity in the arts of Controversy was so remarkably contrasted by his
abilities in reasoning and literature, as to be ever putting one in mind
of what travellers tell us of the genius of the proper Indians, who,
although the veriest bunglers in all the fine arts of manual operation,
yet excel everybody in slight of hand and the delusive feats of
activity.&#8221;<small><a name="f16.1" id="f16.1" href="#f16">[16]</a></small> Whatever may be said of Collins and his achievement, one
fact remains constant. He was a brilliant and persistent trickster whose
cunning in the techniques of polemic often silenced an opponent with every
substantive right to win the debate.</p>

<p>He seized any opportunity to expose the diversity of ethical and
theological opinion which set one Anglican divine against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> another, &#8220;to
observe&#8221;&mdash;as Jenkin put it&mdash;&#8220;how the gladiators in dispute murder the
cause between them, while they so fiercely cut and wound one another.&#8221; For
Collins such observation was more than oratorical artifice; it was one of
the dogmas of his near-nihilism. He commented once to Des Maizeaux upon
the flurry of critics who replied to his statement of necessitarianism in
the <i>Philosophical Inquiry concerning Human Liberty</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I was extreamly pleasd with B<sup>P</sup> Hoadley, ... as it was upon the true
and only point worth disputing with y<sup>e</sup> Preists, viz whether we the
laity are the Calves and Sheep of the Preist. And I am not less
pleasd to see them manage this controversy with y<sup>e</sup> same vile arts
against one another, as they always use towards the laity. It must
open the eyes of a few and convince them, that the Preists mean
nothing but wealth and power, and have not the least ... of those
qualitys for w<sup>ch</sup> the superstitious world admires them.<small><a name="f17.1" id="f17.1" href="#f17">[17]</a></small></p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He applied this principle of divisive attack in <i>A Discourse of
Free-Thinking</i>. There in fifty-three pages he transparently ridiculed
contradictions which hedged three areas of fundamental religious belief:
<i>&#8220;The Nature and Attributes of the Eternal Being or God, ... the Authority
of Scriptures, and ... the Sense of Scripture.&#8221;</i> In accordance with one of
his favorite tricks&mdash;the massing of eminent authority&mdash;his exposition
rings with hallowed Anglican names: South, Bull, Taylor, Wallis, Carlton,
Davenant, Edwards, More, Tillotson, Fowler, Sherlock, Stillingfleet,
Sacheverell, Beveridge, Grabe, Hickes, Lesley.<small><a name="f18.1" id="f18.1" href="#f18">[18]</a></small> What united these men,
he insinuated, was not a Christian commitment but a talent to disagree
with one another and even to repudiate themselves&mdash;as in the case of
Stillingfleet. In effect, the entire <i>Discourse</i> bubbles with a carelessly
suppressed snicker.</p>

<p>The clergy could not readily reply to this kind of incriminating exposure
or deny its reality. They therefore overreacted to other judgments that
Collins made, particularly to his attacks upon Christian revelation. These
they denigrated as misleading, guileful, sinister, contrived, deceitful,
insidious, shuffling, covert, subversive. What they objected to was,
first, the way in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span> he reduced the demonstration of Christian
revelation to only the &#8220;puzzling and perplexing&#8221; argument from prophecy,
the casual ease with which he ignored or dismissed those other &#8220;clear&#8221;
proofs derived from the miracles of Jesus and the resurrection itself.<small><a name="f19.1" id="f19.1" href="#f19">[19]</a></small>
But even more the orthodox resented the masked point of view from which
Collins presented his disbelief.</p>

<p>For example, the <i>Grounds and Reasons</i> is the deist&#8217;s first extended
attack upon revelation. Ostensibly it is, as we have seen, an answer to
Whiston&#8217;s <i>Essay Towards Restoring the True Text of the Old Testament; and
for Vindicating the Citations Made Thence in the New Testament</i> (1722). In
it the mathematician argued that the Hebraic prophecies relating to the
messiah had been literally fulfilled in Jesus. But this truth, he
admitted, had been obscured &#8220;in the latter Ages,&#8221; only because of those
&#8220;Difficulties&#8221; which &#8220;have [almost wholly] arisen from the Corruptions,
the unbelieving <i>Jews</i> introduc&#8217;d into the Hebrew and Greek copies of the
Old Testament, [soon after] the Beginning of the Second Century.&#8221; These
conspiratorial corruptions he single-handedly planned to remove, returning
the Old Testament to a state of textual purity with emendations drawn from
sources as varied as the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Greek Psalms, the
Antiquities of Josephus, the Chaldee Paraphrases, the books of Philo. His
pragmatic purpose was to nullify the biblical criticism of historical
minded scholars as reputable as Grotius, to render useless the allegorical
interpretation of messianic prophecies. That is, he saw in the latter a
&#8220;pernicious&#8221; absence of fact, a &#8220;weak and enthusiastical&#8221; whimsy,
unchristian adjustments to the exigencies of the moment.<small><a name="f20.1" id="f20.1" href="#f20">[20]</a></small></p>

<p>Collins fought not to destroy Whiston&#8217;s position, which was all too easily
destructible, but to undermine the structure, the very &#8220;grounds and
reasons&#8221; with which orthodoxy supported the mysteries of its faith. To do
so, he spun a gigantic web of irony controlled by a persona whose complex
purpose was concealed by a mien of hyper-righteousness. Here then was one
motivated by a fair-mindedness which allowed him to defend his opponent&#8217;s
right of scriptural exegesis even while disagreeing with its approach and
its conclusions. Here too was a conservative Christian different from
Whiston &#8220;and many other great divines; who seem to pay little deference to
the books of the New Testament,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> the text whereof they are perpetually
mending in their sermons, commentaries, and writings, to serve purposes;
who pretend <i>we should have more of the true text by being less tenacious
of the printed one</i>, and in consequence thereof, presume to correct by
critical <i>emendations</i>, serve <i>capital places</i> in the <i>sacred writers</i>;
and who ... do virtually set aside the authority of the scripture, and
place those compositions in its stead.&#8221; Finally, here was one who,
obedient to the spirit of God&#8217;s revealed word, rejected the fallacy that
messianic prophecy had been fulfilled in Christ in any &#8220;literal, obvious
and primary sense.&#8221;<small><a name="f21.1" id="f21.1" href="#f21">[21]</a></small></p>

<p>But though the persona could not accept Whiston&#8217;s program, he was not a
mere negativist. With growing excitement he argued for allegorical
interpretation. At this point the reader discerns that he has been duped,
that nowhere has there been a denial of Whiston&#8217;s charge that the reading
of messianic prophecy in a typical or allegorical or secondary sense is
&#8220;weak and enthusiastical.&#8221; On the contrary, the reader finds only the
damning innuendo that the two methods&mdash;the allegorical and the
literal&mdash;differ from one another not in kind but in degree of absurdity.
After being protected for a long time by all the twists and turns of his
creator&#8217;s irony, the persona finally reveals himself for what he is, a man
totally insolent and totally without remorse. Never for one moment did he
wish to defend the scheme of allegorical prophecy but to attack it. His
argument, stripped of its convolutions and pseudo-piety, moves inexorably
to a single, negative conclusion. &#8220;Christianity pretends to derive itself
from Judaism. JESUS appeals to the religious books of the Jews as
prophesying of his Mission. None of these Prophecies can be understood of
him but in a <i>typical allegoric</i> sense. Now that sense is absurd, and
contrary to all scholastic rules of interpretation. Christianity,
therefore, not being really predicted in the Jewish Writings, is
consequently false.&#8221;<small><a name="f22.1" id="f22.1" href="#f22">[22]</a></small></p>

<p>Collins continued his attack upon Christian revelation in the <i>Scheme</i>. In
the two years which separated this work from the earlier <i>Grounds and
Reasons</i>, there occurred no change in the author&#8217;s argument. What does
occur, however, is a perceptive if snide elaboration upon the mask. This
is in many ways the same persona who barely suppressed his guffaws in the
earlier work. Now he is given an added dimension; he is made more
decisively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span> rational than his predecessor and therefore more insightful in
his knowledge of rhetorical method. As a disciple of certain Protestant
polemicists and particularly of Grotius, whose &#8220;integrity,&#8221; &#8220;honor,&#8221; and
biblical criticism he supports, he is the empirical-minded Christian who
knows exactly why the literalists have failed to persuade the
free-thinkers or even to have damaged their arguments. &#8220;For if you begin
with Infidels by denying to them, what is evident and agreeable to common
sense, I think there can be no reasonable hopes of converting or
convincing them.&#8221;<small><a name="f23.1" id="f23.1" href="#f23">[23]</a></small> The irony is abrasive simply because it unanswerably
singles out the great rhetorical failure of orthodoxy, its inability to
argue from a set of principles as acceptable to the deists as to
themselves.</p>

<p>Many of the clergy chafed against Collins&#8217;s manipulation of this
tongue-in-cheek persona. They resented his irreverent wit which projected,
for example, the image of an Anglican God who &#8220;talks to all mankind from
corners&#8221; and who shows his back parts to Moses. They were irritated by his
jesting parables, as in &#8220;The Case of Free-Seeing,&#8221; and by the impertinence
of labelling Archbishop Tillotson as the man &#8220;whom all <i>English
Free-Thinkers</i> own as their Head.&#8221;<small><a name="f24.1" id="f24.1" href="#f24">[24]</a></small></p>

<p>But most of all they gagged upon Collins&#8217;s use of satire in religious
controversy. As we have already seen, there were complex reasons for his
choice of technique. He was a naturally witty man who, sometimes out of
fear and sometimes out of malice, expressed himself best through
circuitous irony. In 1724, when he himself considered his oratorical
practice, he argued that his matter determined his style, that the targets
of his belittling wit were the &#8220;saint-errants.&#8221; We can only imagine the
exasperation of Collins&#8217;s Anglican enemies when they found their orthodoxy
thus slyly lumped with the eccentricities of Samuel Butler&#8217;s &#8220;true blew&#8221;
Presbyterians. It would be hard to live down the associations of those
facetious lines which made the Augustan divines, like their unwelcome
forebear Hudibras, members</p>

<p class="poem"><span style="margin-left: 10em;">Of that stubborn Crew</span><br />
Of Errant Saints, whom all men grant<br />
To be the true Church Militant.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>Those dignified Anglican exteriors were further punctured by Collins&#8217;s
irreverent attack upon their cry of religious uniformity, a cry which was
&#8220;ridiculous, romantick, and impossible to succeed.&#8221; He saw himself, in
short, as an emancipated Butler or even Cervantes; and like his famous
predecessors he too would laugh quite out of countenance the fool and the
hypocrite, the pretender and the enthusiast, the knave and the persecuter,
all those who would create a god in their own sour and puny image.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>By 1727 several of the orthodox felt that they could take no more of
Collins&#8217;s laughter, his sneering invectives against the clergy, or his
designs to make religion &#8220;a Matter purely personal; and the Knowledge of
it to be obtain&#8217;d by personal Consideration, <i>independently of any Guides,
Teachers, or Authority</i>.&#8221; In the forefront of this group was John Rogers,
whose hostility to the deist was articulate and compulsive. At least it
drove him into a position seemingly at odds with the spirit if not the law
of English toleration. He urged, for example, that those like Collins be
prosecuted in a civil court for a persuasion &#8220;which is manifestly
subversive of all Order and Polity, and can no more consist with civil,
than with religious, Society.&#8221;<small><a name="f25.1" id="f25.1" href="#f25">[25]</a></small></p>

<p>Thereupon followed charge and countercharge. New gladiators, as different
from each other as the nonconformist divine Samuel Chandler and the deist
Thomas Chubb, entered the arena on behalf of Collins. For all the dogmatic
volubility of Rogers, orthodoxy appeared beleaguered. The moderate clergy,
who witnessed this exchange, became alarmed; they feared that in the melee
the very heart of English toleration would be threatened by the
contenders, all of whom spoke as its champion. Representative of such
moderation was Nathanael Marshall, who wished if not to end the debate,
then at least to contain its ardor. As canon of Windsor, he supported the
condition of a state religion protected by the magistrate but he worried
over the extent of the latter&#8217;s prerogative and power. Certainly he was
more liberal than Rogers in his willingness to entertain professions of
religious diversity. Yet he straitjacketed his liberalism when he denied
responsible men the right to attack<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span> laws, both civil and canonical, with
&#8220;ludicrous Insult&#8221; or &#8220;with Buffoonery and Banter, Ridicule or Sarcastick
Irony.&#8221;<small><a name="f26.1" id="f26.1" href="#f26">[26]</a></small></p>

<p>Once again Collins met the challenge. In <i>A Discourse concerning Ridicule
and Irony</i> he devoted himself to undermining the moral, the intellectual,
and practical foundations of that one restraint which Marshall would
impose upon the conduct of any religious quarrel. He had little difficulty
in achieving his objective. His adversary&#8217;s stand was visibly vulnerable
and for several reasons. It was too conscious of the tug-of-war between
the deist and Rogers, too arbitrary in its choice of prohibition. It was,
in truth, strained by a choice between offending the establishment and yet
rejecting clerical extremism.<small><a name="f27.1" id="f27.1" href="#f27">[27]</a></small> Moreover, Collins had this time an
invisible partner, a superior thinker against whom he could test his own
ideas and from whom he could borrow others. For the <i>Discourse concerning
Ridicule and Irony</i> is largely a particularization, a crude but powerful
reworking of Shaftesbury&#8217;s <i>Sensus Communis: An Essay on the Freedom of
Wit and Humour</i>.</p>

<p>Supported by Shaftesbury&#8217;s urbane generalization, Collins laughed openly
at the egocentricity and blindness of Marshall&#8217;s timid zealotry. Indeed,
he wryly found his orthodox opponent guilty of the very crime with which
he, as a subversive, was charged. It seemed to him, he said,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>a most prodigious Banter upon [mankind], for Men to talk in general
of the <i>Immorality</i> of <i>Ridicule</i> and <i>Irony</i>, and of <i>punishing</i> Men
for those Matters, when their own Practice is <i>universal Irony</i> and
<i>Ridicule</i> of all those who go not with them, and <i>universal
Applause</i> and <i>Encouragement</i> for such <i>Ridicule</i> and <i>Irony</i>, and
distinguishing by all the honourable ways imaginable such <i>drolling</i>
Authors for their Drollery; and when Punishment for <i>Drollery</i> is
never call&#8217;d for, but when <i>Drollery</i> is used or employ&#8217;d against them!</p>

<p class="right">(<a href="#Page_29">p. 29</a>)</p></div>

<p>Collins&#8217;s technique continued its ironic ambiguity, reversal, and
obliquity. Under a tone of seeming innocence and good will, he credited
his adversaries with an enviable capacity for satiric<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span> argument. In
comradely fashion, he found precedent for his own rhetorical practice
through a variety of historical and biblical analogies. But even more
important for a contemporary audience, he again resorted to the device of
invoking the authority provided by some of the most respected names in the
Anglican Establishment. The use of satire in religious topics, hence, was
manifest in &#8220;the Writings of our most eminent Divines,&#8221; especially those
of Stillingfleet, &#8220;our greatest controversial Writer&#8221; (<a href="#Page_4">pp. 4-5</a>).</p>

<p>With all the outrageous assurance of a self-invited guest, the deist had
seated himself at the table of his vainly protesting Christian hosts (whom
he insisted on identifying as brethren). &#8220;In a word,&#8221; he said so as to
obviate debate, &#8220;the Opinions and Practices of Men in all Matters, and
especially in Matters of Religion, are generally so absurd and ridiculous
that it is impossible for them not to be the Subjects of Ridicule&#8221; (<a href="#Page_19">p. 19</a>). Thus adopting Juvenal&#8217;s concept of
satiric necessity (&#8220;difficile est saturam non scribere&#8221;), Collins here set forth the thesis and rationale of
his enemy. There was a kind of impudent virtuosity in his &#8220;proofs,&#8221; in his
manner of drawing a large, impressive cluster of names into his ironic net
and making all of them appear to be credible witnesses in his defense.
Even Swift, amusingly compromised as &#8220;one of the greatest <i>Droles</i> that
ever appear&#8217;d upon the Stage of the World&#8221; (<a href="#Page_39">p. 39</a>), was brought to the
witness box as evidence of the privileged status to which satiric writing
was entitled. Collins enforced erudition with cool intelligence so that
contemptuous amusement is present on every page of his <i>Discourse</i>.</p>

<p>Beneath his jeers and his laughter there was a serious denunciation of any
kind of intellectual restraint, however mild-seeming; beneath his verbal
pin-pricking there was conversely an exoneration of man&#8217;s right to
inquire, to profess, and to persuade. Beneath his jests and sarcasms there
was further a firm philosophical commitment that informed the rhetoric of
all his earlier work. Ridicule, he asserted in 1729, &#8220;is both a proper and
necessary Method of Discourse in many Cases, and especially in the Case of
<i>Gravity</i>, when that is attended with Hypocrisy or Imposture, or with
Ignorance, or with soureness of Temper and Persecution: all which ought to
draw after them the <i>Ridicule</i> and <i>Contempt</i> of the Society, which has no
other effectual Remedy against such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span> Methods of Imposition&#8221; (<a href="#Page_22">p. 22</a>).</p>

<p>For the modern reader the <i>Discourse concerning Ridicule and Irony</i> is the
most satisfactory of Collins&#8217;s many pamphlets and books. It lacks the
pretentiousness of the <i>Scheme</i>, the snide convolutions of the <i>Grounds
and Reasons</i>, the argument by half-truths of the <i>Discourse of
Free-Thinking</i>. His last work is free of the curious ambivalence which
marked so many of his earlier pieces, a visible uncertainty which made him
fear repression and yet court it. On the contrary, his last work is in
fact a justification of his rhetorical mode and religious beliefs; it is
an <i>apologia pro vita sua</i> written with all the intensity and decisiveness
that such a justification demands. To be sure, it takes passing shots at
old enemies like Swift, but never with rancor. And while its language is
frequently ironical, its thinking makes an earnest defense of wit as a
weapon of truth. The essay sets forth its author as an <i>animal ridens</i>, a
creature that through laughter and affable cynicism worships a universal
God and respects a rational mankind.</p>

upon as early as March when on the 10th of that month Samuel Chandler
published his <i>Reflections on the Conduct of the Modern Deists in their
late Writings against Christianity</i>. (For the dating of Chandler&#8217;s work,
see the <i>Daily Courant</i> [10 March 1727].) We know also that the <i>Scheme</i>

<p>You profess to &#8220;vindicate <small><a name="f29.1" id="f29.1" href="#f29">[29]</a></small> a sober, serious, and modest Inquiry into

he may think of ill Consequence by its Continuance. If he be a Man of

but if he mistakes his Talent, and will be busy with what he very little
understands, Contempt and Odium will be his unavoidable and just
Allotment.&#8221; And you say, that &#8220;Religion is more a personal Affair, in
which every Man has a peculiar Right and Interest, and a Concern that he
be not mistaken, than in any other Case or Instance which can fall under
the Cognizance of the Magistrate; and that greater Allowances seem due to
each private Person for Examination and Inquiry in this, than in any other
Example.&#8221;</p>

<p>And herein I must do you the Justice to acknowledge, that you speak like a
Christian, like a Protestant, like an <i>Englishman</i>, and a reasonable Man;
like a Man concerned for Truth, like a Man of Conscience; like a Man
concern&#8217;d for the Consciences of others; like a Man concern&#8217;d to have some
Sense, Learning, and Virtue in the World; and, in a word, like a Man who
is not for abandoning all the valuable Things in Life to the Tyranny,
Ambition, and Covetousness of Magistrates and Ecclesiasticks.</p>

<p>But you observe, that &#8220;municipal Laws<small><a name="f30.1" id="f30.1" href="#f30">[30]</a></small>, how trivial soever in their
intrinsick Value, are never to be <i>insulted</i>; never to be treated with
<i>Buffoonery</i> and <i>Banter</i>, <i>Ridicule</i> and <i>Sarcastick Irony</i>. So that Dr.
<i>Rogers</i>&#8217;s grand Adversary will have from you no measure of Encouragement
to his manner of Writing.&#8221; Again, you &#8220;never <small><a name="f31.1" id="f31.1" href="#f31">[31]</a></small> desire to see the
Magistrate fencing in the publick Religion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> with so thick a Hedge as shall
exclude all Light, and shall tear out the Eyes of all such as endeavour to
see thro&#8217; it. <i>Sober arguing</i> you never fear: <i>Mockery</i> and <i>bitter
Railing</i>, if you could help it, you would never bear, either <i>for the
Truth or against it</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon which I offer these following Considerations.</p>

<p>I. <i>First</i>, If what you call <i>Insult</i>, <i>Buffoonery</i>, <i>Banter</i>, <i>Ridicule</i>
and <i>Irony</i>, <i>Mockery</i> and <i>bitter Railing</i>, be Crimes in Disputation, you
will find none more deeply involv&#8217;d in it than our most famous Writers, in
their controversial Treatises about <i>serious</i> Matters; as all Notions and
Practices in Religion, whether reasonable or absurd, may be equally and
justly deem&#8217;d: the Notions and Practices of Papists, Presbyterians,
Quakers, and all other Sects, being no less <i>serious</i> to their respective
Sects than ridiculous to one another. Let any Man read the Writings of our
most eminent Divines against the <i>Papists</i>, <i>Puritans</i>, <i>Dissenters</i>, and
<i>Hereticks</i>, and against one another, and particularly the Writings of
<i>Alexander Cook</i>, <i>Hales</i>, <i>Chillingworth</i>, <i>Patrick</i>, <i>Tillotson</i>,
<i>Stillingfleet</i>, <i>Burnet</i>, <i>South</i>, <i>Hickes</i>, <i>Sherlock</i> and <i>Edwards</i>,
and he will find them to abound with <i>Banter</i>, <i>Ridicule</i>, and <i>Irony</i>.
<i>Stillingfleet</i> in particular, our greatest controversial Writer, who
passes for <i>grave</i> and <i>solemn</i>, is so conscious of his use thereof, that
he confesses that Charge of the Papists against him, saying<small><a name="f32.1" id="f32.1" href="#f32">[32]</a></small>, &#8220;But I
forget my Adversary&#8217;s grave admonition, that I <i>would treat these Matters
seriously, and lay aside Drollery</i>.&#8221; And again, after a <i>Banter</i> of near a
Page, he says<small><a name="f33.1" id="f33.1" href="#f33">[33]</a></small>, &#8220;But I forget I am so near my Adversary&#8217;s Conclusion,
wherein he so <i>gravely</i> advises me, that I <i>would be pleas&#8217;d for once</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> <i>to
write Controversy, and not Play-Books</i>.&#8221; Nor did I ever hear the Divines
of the Church condemn the Doctor for his sarcastical Method of writing
Controversy. On the contrary, I remember at the University, that he used
to be applauded no less for his Wit than for his Learning. And to exalt
his Character as a Wit, his <i>Conferences between a</i> Romish <i>Priest, a
Fanatick Chaplain, and a Divine of the Church of</i> England, <i>&amp;c.</i> were
spoken of as an excellent <i>Comedy</i>, and especially for that Part which the
<i>Fanatick Chaplain</i> acts therein, who makes as comical and as ridiculous a
Figure as he does in any of the <i>Plays</i> acted on the Stage. And in his
<i>Controversy</i> with <i>Dryden</i> about the <i>Royal Papers</i>, and those of the
<i>Duchess</i> of <i>York</i>, he was deem&#8217;d to have out-done that famous <i>Satirist</i>
in tart Repartees and Reflections; and to have attack&#8217;d the Character of
the <i>Poet</i> with more severity, than that <i>Poet</i>, who was so remarkable for
his satirical Reflections on the holy Order, did the Character of the
<i>Divine</i>: As for example, he says to <i>Dryden</i><small><a name="f34.1" id="f34.1" href="#f34">[34]</a></small>, &#8220;Could nothing be said
by you of Bishop <i>Morley</i>, but that <i>Prelate of rich Memory</i>? Or had you a
mind to tell us he was no <i>Poet</i>? Or that he was out of the Temptation of
changing his Religion for Bread?&#8221; And many Citations us&#8217;d to be produc&#8217;d
out of his Writings, as Specimens of his ironical Talent; among which I
particularly remember his <i>Ridicule</i> of his Adversary Mr. <i>Alsop</i>, a
famous Presbyterian Wit and Divine; whose Book, which was full of low
Raillery and Ridicule, he resembles <small><a name="f35.1" id="f35.1" href="#f35">[35]</a></small> to <i>the Bird of</i> Athens, as <i>made
up of Face and Feathers</i>. And the Doctor himself adds, in Justification of
the polite Method of Raillery in Controversy, that <i>there is a
pleasantness of Wit, which serves to entertain</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> <i>the Reader in the rough
and deep way of Controversy</i>. Nor did Mr. <i>Alsop</i> want Approvers of his
Raillery in his own Party. Mr. <i>Gilbert Rule</i><small><a name="f36.1" id="f36.1" href="#f36">[36]</a></small>, a great <i>Scotch</i>
Presbyterian Divine, who defended him against <i>Stillingfleet</i>, contends in
behalf of his Raillery, &#8220;That the Facetiousness of Mr. <i>Alsop</i>&#8217;s Strain
needed to have bred no Disgust, being as a Condiment to prevent <i>T&aelig;dium</i>
and Nauseousness.&#8221; And he adds, &#8220;That he knows none that blame the
excellent Writings of Mr. <i>Fuller</i>, which have a Pleasantness not unlike
that of Mr. <i>Alsop</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>And this manner of writing is seldom complain&#8217;d of, as unfit to be
allow&#8217;d, by any but those who feel themselves hurt by it. For the solemn
and grave can bear a solemn and grave Attack: That gives them a sort of
Credit in the World, and makes them appear considerable to themselves, as
worthy of a serious Regard. But <i>Contempt</i> is what they, who commonly are
the most contemptible and worthless of Men, cannot bear nor withstand, as
setting them in their true Light, and being the most effectual Method to
drive Imposture, the sole Foundation of their Credit, out of the World.
Hence <i>Stillingfleet</i>&#8217;s Popish Adversaries, more conscious perhaps of the
Ridiculousness of Popery than the common People among Protestants
themselves, fall upon him very furiously. One says<small><a name="f37.1" id="f37.1" href="#f37">[37]</a></small>, &#8220;That by the
Phrases, which are the chief Ornaments that set off the Doctor&#8217;s Works, we
may easily guess in what Books he has spent his Time; and that he is well
vers&#8217;d in <i>Don Quixot</i>, the <i>Seven Champions</i>, and other <i>Romantick
Stories</i>. Sure the Doctor err&#8217;d in his Vocation: Had he quitted all
serious Matters, and dedicated himself wholly to Drollery and Romance,
with two or three <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>Years under <i>Hudibras</i>, he might have been a Master in
that Faculty; the Stage might have been a Gainer by it, and the Church of
<i>England</i> would have been no Loser.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another of his Adversaries says, &#8220;<small><a name="f38.1" id="f38.1" href="#f38">[38]</a></small>Peruse the Doctor Page after Page,
you will find the Man all along in peevish Humour, when you see his Book
brimfull of tart biting Ironies, Drolleries, comical Expressions,
impertinent Demands, and idle Stories, <i>&amp;c.</i> as if the discharging a
little Gall were enough to disparage <i>the clearest Miracles</i> God ever wrought.&#8221;</p>

<p>But what are these <i>clearest Miracles God ever wrought</i>? Why, the most
extravagant, whimsical, absurd, and ridiculous Legends and Stories
imaginable; such as that of <i>St. Dominick</i><small><a name="f39.1" id="f39.1" href="#f39">[39]</a></small>, who when the Devil came to
him in the Shape of a <i>Monkey</i>, made him hold a Candle to him while he
wrote, and keep it so long between his Toes, till it burnt them; and his
keeping the Devil, who sometimes came to him in the Shape of a <i>Flea</i>, and
by skipping on the Leaves of his Book disturb&#8217;d his Reading, in that
Shape, and using him for a Mark to know where he left off reading: Such as
St. <i>Patrick</i>&#8217;s heating an Oven with Snow, and turning a Pound of Honey
into a Pound of Butter: Such as <i>Christ</i>&#8217;s marrying Nuns, and playing at
Cards with them; and Nuns living on the Milk of the blessed Virgin <i>Mary</i>;
and that of divers Orders, and especially the <i>Benedictine</i>, being so dear
to the blessed Virgin, that in Heaven she lodges them under her
Petticoats: Such as making broken Eggs whole; <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>and of People, who had
their Heads cut off, walking with their Heads in their Hands, which were
sometimes set on again: Such as Failing for a hundred Years; and raising
Cows, Calves, and Birds from the Dead, after they had been chopt to Pieces
and eaten, and putting on their Heads after they had been pull&#8217;d or cut
off; and turning a Pound of Butter into a Bell; and making a Bull give
Milk; and raising a King&#8217;s Daughter from the Dead, and turning her into a
Son; and the several Translations thro&#8217; the Air of the Virgin <i>Mary</i>&#8217;s
House from <i>Palestine</i> to <i>Loretto</i>, and the Miracles wrote there; and
more of the like Kind.</p>

<p>Are these, or such as these the <i>clearest Miracles God ever wrought</i>? Do
such Miracles deserve a serious Regard? And shall the <i>Gravity</i> with which
Mankind is thus banter&#8217;d out of their common Sense, excuse these Matters
from <i>Ridicule</i>?</p>

<p>It will be difficult to find any Writers who have exceeded the Doctors,
<i>South</i> and <small><a name="f40.1" id="f40.1" href="#f40">[40]</a></small> <i>Edwards</i>, in <i>Banter</i>, <i>Irony</i>, <i>Satire</i> and <i>Sarcasms</i>:
The last of whom has written a Discourse in <i>Defence of sharp Reflections
on Authors and their Opinions</i>; wherein he enumerates, as Examples for his
Purpose, almost all the eminent Divines of the Church of <i>England</i>. And
Mr. <small><a name="f41.1" id="f41.1" href="#f41">[41]</a></small> <i>Collier</i>, speaking of a Letter of the Venerable <i>Bede</i> to
<i>Egbert</i> Bishop of <i>York</i>, says, &#8220;The Satire and Declamation in this
<i>Epistle</i> shews the <i>pious Zeal</i> and <i>Integrity</i> of the Author;&#8221; which
seems to imply, that <i>Satire</i> and <i>Declamation</i> is the orthodox and most
pious Method of writing in behalf of <i>Orthodoxy</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>Dr. <i>Rogers</i>, to whom you write, falls into the Method of Buffoonery,
Banter, Satire, Drollery, Ridicule, and Irony, even in the Treatise to
which your Letter is subjoined, and against that <i>Person</i> whom you would
have punish&#8217;d for that Method: When he says to him, <small><a name="f42.1" id="f42.1" href="#f42">[42]</a></small> &#8220;Religion then,
it seems, must be left to the Scholars and Gentlefolks, and to them &#8217;tis
to be of no other use, but as a Subject of Disputation to improve their
Parts and Learning; but methinks the Vulgar might be indulged a little of
it now and then, upon Sundays and Holidays, instead of Bull-baiting and
Foot-ball.&#8221; And this insipid Piece of Drollery and false Wit [which is
design&#8217;d to ridicule his Adversary for asserting, that <i>What Men
understand nothing of, they have no Concern about</i>; which is a Proposition
that will stand the Test of <i>Ridicule</i>, which will be found wholly to lie
against the Doctor, for asserting the Reasonableness of imposing Things on
the People which they do not understand] is the more remarkable, as it
proceeds from one, who is at the same time for using the Sword of the
Magistrate against his Adversary. One would think the <small><a name="f43.1" id="f43.1" href="#f43">[43]</a></small> <i>Inquisitor</i>
should banish the <i>Droll</i>, and the <i>Droll</i> the <i>Inquisitor</i>.</p>

<p>One of the greatest and best Authorities for the <i>pleasant</i> and <i>ironical</i>
manner of treating <i>serious</i> Matters, is that eminent Divine at the Time
of the Reformation, the great <i>Erasmus</i>, who has written two Books in this
way with great Applause of Protestants, and without subjecting himself to
any Persecution of Papists: which makes it highly proper to propose them
to the Consideration of the Reader, that he may regulate his Notions, by
what, it <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>may be presum&#8217;d, he approves of in that Author. These two Books
of <i>Erasmus</i> are his <i>Colloquies</i>, and his <i>Praise of Folly</i>.</p>

<p>His <i>Colloquies</i> were wrote in imitation of <i>Lucian</i>&#8217;s <i>Dialogues</i>; and I
think with equal, if not superior, Success.</p>

<p>Both these Authors had an Aversion to sullen, austere, designing Knaves;
and both of them being Men of Wit and Satire, employ&#8217;d their Talents
against <i>Superstition</i> and <i>Hypocrisy</i>. <i>Lucian</i> liv&#8217;d in an Age when
<i>Fiction</i> and <i>Fable</i> had usurp&#8217;d the Name of <i>Religion</i>, and <i>Morality</i>
was corrupted by <i>Men</i> of <i>Beard</i> and <i>Grimace</i>, but scandalously <i>Leud</i>
and <i>Ignorant</i>; who yet had the Impudence to preach up <i>Virtue</i>, and style
themselves <i>Philosophers</i>, perpetually clashing with one another about the
Precedence of their several Founders, the Merits of their different Sects,
and if &#8217;tis possible, about Trifles of less Importance: yet all agreeing
in a different way to dupe and amuse the poor People, by the <i>fantastick</i>
Singularity of their Habits, the unintelligible Jargon of their Schools,
and their Pretensions to a severe and mortify&#8217;d Life.</p>

<p>These Jugglers and Impostors <i>Lucian</i> in great measure help&#8217;d to chase out
of the World, by exposing them in their proper Colours, and by
representing them as ridiculous as they were. But in a few Generations
after him, a new Race of Men sprung up in the World, well known by the
Name of <i>Monks</i> and <i>Fryars</i>, different indeed from the former in
Religion, Garb, and a few other Circumstances; but in the main, the same
sort of Impostors, the same ever-lasting Cobweb-Spinners, as to their
nonsensical Controversies, the same abandon&#8217;d <i>Wretches</i>, as to their
Morals; but as to the mysterious Arts of heaping up Wealth, and picking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the People&#8217;s Pockets, infinitely superior to the <i>Pagan Philosophers</i> and
<i>Priests</i>. These were the sanctify&#8217;d Cheats, whose Folly and Vices
<i>Erasmus</i> has so effectually lash&#8217;d, that some Countries have entirely
turn&#8217;d these Drones out of their Cells; and in other Places, where they
are still kept up, they are in some measure become contemptible, and
obliged to be always on their Guard.</p>

<p>The Papists say, that these &#8220;<small><a name="f44.1" id="f44.1" href="#f44">[44]</a></small><i>Colloquies</i>, by turning into <i>Ridicule</i>
the Devotion to the holy Virgin and Saints, the Worship of Relicks and
Images, religious Vows and Pilgrimages, have made more Hereticks than the
Works of <i>Luther</i> and <i>Calvin</i>.&#8221; And I find the reverend Mr. <i>Trapp</i>
[after calling <small><a name="f45.1" id="f45.1" href="#f45">[45]</a></small> <i>Reliques</i>, <span class="smcap">Foolish</span>] celebrates <i>Erasmus</i> for <i>having
abundantly</i> <span class="smcap">ridicul&#8217;d</span> <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>His <i>Praise of Folly</i> treats of <i>serious</i> Matters, in such a gay,
familiar, ingenious and pleasant manner, as makes it a Work proper to be
read by intelligent People, to remove out of their Minds all Bigotry
contracted by Ignorance and an evil Education, all Peevishness, Hatred,
and Ill-nature towards one another, on account of different Sentiments in
Religion; and to form in them the natural Principles of Moderation,
Humanity, Affection and Friendship. Our learned and ingenious Bishop
<i>Kennet</i> could not do a more signal Piece of Service to our Country, than
by translating into <i>English</i> this Book, which the Ladies have now an
Opportunity of understanding no less than the Men; and from whence they
may see the pleasant, amiable, and just Disposition of Mind of one of the
most learned and ingenious Men that ever liv&#8217;d, as well <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>as Author of a
great Number of religious and devotional Books; nor could the Bishop well
give a heartier Stroke at Popery, than by approving of <i>Erasmus</i>&#8217;s <small><a name="f46.1" id="f46.1" href="#f46">[46]</a></small>
<i>laughing</i> at it, and applauding his numberless <i>Taunts on its Impostures,
Cheats, and Delusions</i>.</p>

<p>Our Clergy have ever treated Mr. <i>Hobbes</i> with the greatest Mockery,
Ridicule and Raillery: As for example, <i>Ward</i> Bishop of <i>Sarum</i>, <i>Brambal</i>
Bishop of <i>Derry</i>, <i>Parker</i> Bishop of <i>Oxford</i>, Dr. <i>Wallis</i> in his
several bantering Treatises against him, <i>Lucy</i> Bishop of <i>St. Davids,
Shafto</i>, and particularly the Reverend <i>Droll</i>, Dr. <i>Eachard</i>, in two
<i>Dialogues</i>, which, it is well known, have been universally well receiv&#8217;d
by the Clergy, and that for their Treatment of Mr. <i>Hobbes</i> in the
ridiculing Way; for which the Author himself makes the following just
Apology, in his <i>Dedication</i> of his <i>Second Dialogue</i> to Archbishop
<i>Sheldon</i>, &#8220;That of all Triflers, &#8217;tis the <i>Set</i>, the <i>Grave</i>, the
<i>Philosophical</i>, and the <i>Mathematical Trifler</i>, to which he has the
greatest Aversion; whom when he meets, very gravely making out all Men to
be rational Beasts both in Nature and Conversation, and every Man, he
pleases, a rational Rebel; and upon any Fright or Pinch a rational Atheist
and Anti-Christian; and all this perform&#8217;d with all <span class="smcap">Demureness</span>, <span class="smcap">Solemnity</span>,
<span class="smcap">Quotation</span> of <span class="smcap">Scripture</span>, <span class="smcap">Appeals</span> to <span class="smcap">Conscience</span> and <span class="smcap">Church-History</span>; he must
humbly beg his <i>Grace&#8217;s</i> Pardon, if then he has endeavour&#8217;d to <span class="smcap">smile</span> a
little, and to get as much out of his Road and way of Writing as
possible.&#8221; These <i>Dialogues</i> used to be much recommended to the Youth to
make them laugh at Mr <i>Hobbes</i>, who <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>was constantly represented as
provok&#8217;d and put out of all Temper by them, and was said to have vented
this strange and impious Expression, upon its being told him, that <i>the
Clergy said</i> Eachard <i>had crucify&#8217;d</i> Hobbes; &#8220;Why then don&#8217;t they fall
down and worship me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Selden</i> has been the constant Subject of Clergy-banter, for his
<i>History of Tythes</i>; in the <i>Preface</i> to which, &#8220;He reproaches the Clergy
with Ignorance and Laziness, and upbraids them with having nothing to keep
up their Credit but <i>Beard</i>, <i>Title</i>, and <i>Habit</i>; and their Studies
reach&#8217;d no farther than the <i>Breviary</i>, the <i>Postils</i>, and <i>Polyanthea</i>.&#8221;
For this Work he was attack&#8217;d more particularly by three Divines,
<i>Tillesly</i>, <i>Mountagu</i>, and <i>Nettles</i>. And their Success was thus
originally represented<small><a name="f47.1" id="f47.1" href="#f47">[47]</a></small>, &#8220;That he was so gall&#8217;d by <i>Tillesly</i>, so
gagg&#8217;d by <i>Mountagu</i>, and so stung by <i>Nettles</i>, that he never came off in
any of his Undertakings with more loss of Credit.&#8221; And this Jest has
pass&#8217;d much upon the World, and been continued down in many Books, where
Mr. <i>Selden</i> is mention&#8217;d, to his Discredit with ignorant Readers, but not
with the Knowing and Learned; who, as Dr. <i>Wotton</i> tells us<small><a name="f48.1" id="f48.1" href="#f48">[48]</a></small>, <i>have,
now Party-heats are over, acquiesced in what Mr.</i> Selden advanc&#8217;d; <i>who
first</i>, <span class="smcap">of all Christians</span>, <i>set the Affair</i> of Tythes <i>in a clear Light</i>.</p>

<p>It is usually said the Comedy called <i>Ignoramus</i>, which is a Clergy-banter
upon the <i>Law</i>, was a design&#8217;d Return for Mr. <i>Selden</i>&#8217;s <i>History of Tythes</i>.</p>

<p>The Reverend Dr. <i>Beaumont</i>, late Master of St. <i>Peter</i>&#8217;s <i>College</i> and
King&#8217;s Professor of Divinity, has given us a Book, entitled, &#8220;Some
Observations <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>upon the Apology of Dr. <i>Henry More</i> for his <i>Mystery of
Godliness</i>;&#8221; which endeavours to render the said Doctor <i>ridiculous</i>, and
set People a <i>laughing</i> at him, (<i>p. 9. &amp;c. 64.</i>) and used to be applauded
as a complete Performance in the way of Raillery and Irony, and was well
receiv&#8217;d for being directed against a Person esteem&#8217;d Heterodox.</p>

<p>Many Clergymen have written Books to banter the Works of Mr. <i>Locke</i>,
among whom Dr. <i>Edwards</i> must have the first Place; whose <i>Brief
Vindication of the fundamental Articles of the Christian Faith</i>, which has
the <i>Imprimatur</i> before it of <i>James</i>, <i>Beaumont</i>, <i>Covel</i>, and
<i>Balderston</i>, four <i>Cambridge</i> Heads, was never exceeded by the most licentious <i>Droll</i>.</p>

<p>When <i>Sorbier</i>&#8217;s <i>Voyage</i> to <i>England</i>, which was a pert and insolent
Abuse and Satire on the Nation, and written in the <i>French</i> manner of
contemptuously treating all Countries and Men but <i>France</i> and
<i>Frenchmen</i>, was publish&#8217;d, it was deem&#8217;d proper that a drolling and
satirical Answer should be given to it, and that the Reverend Dr. <i>Sprat</i>
should be the <i>Droll</i> employ&#8217;d; who perform&#8217;d his Part according to the
Expectation of the Drolling Court of King <i>Charles</i> II. and as the
ingenious Mr. <i>Addison</i> tells us, <small><a name="f49.1" id="f49.1" href="#f49">[49]</a></small> <i>Vindicated the Honour of his
Country, in a Book full of Satire and Ingenuity</i>.</p>

<p>Bishop <i>Beveridge</i> ever pass&#8217;d for a serious and profound Divine; and his
Writings have fix&#8217;d that Character upon him among the Religious of the
High Church, who have receiv&#8217;d his <i>Private Thoughts</i> and his Volumes of
<i>Sermons</i>, like <i>Manna</i> from Heaven. And yet possibly never Man had two
more severe Attacks made upon him than he had; one by Bishop
<i>Stillingfleet</i>, who in <i>A Vindication of their Majesties Authority to
fill the Sees of</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> <i>the depriv&#8217;d Bishops</i>, &amp;c. occasion&#8217;d by Dr.
<i>Beveridge</i>&#8217;s Refusal of the Bishoprick of <i>Bath</i> and <i>Wells</i>, satirizes
both his <i>Prudence</i> and his <i>Sincerity</i>; and another, by an ingenious
Bishop also, who in <i>A short View of Dr.</i> Beveridge<i>&#8217;s Writings</i>, has in a
most refin&#8217;d <i>drolling manner</i> represented those Writings as abounding in
most absurd and ridiculous Divinity.</p>

<p>But one of the justest and finest Pieces of <i>Irony</i>, and the most timely
and seasonably vented, and that deserves perpetual Remembrance, is,
<i>Andrews</i> the grave Bishop of <i>Winchester</i>&#8217;s Irony, on <i>Neal</i> the grave
Bishop of <i>Durham</i>; of which we have the following Relation in the Poet
<i>Waller</i>&#8217;s <i>Life</i>, prefix&#8217;d before his Works: &#8220;On the Day of the
Dissolution of the last Parliament of King <i>James</i> the First, Mr.
<i>Waller</i>, out of Curiosity or Respect, went to see the King at Dinner;
with whom were Dr. <i>Andrews</i> the Bishop of <i>Winchester</i>, and Dr. <i>Neal</i>
Bishop of <i>Durham</i>, standing behind his Majesty&#8217;s Chair. There happen&#8217;d
something very extraordinary in the Conversation those Prelates had with
the King, on which Mr. <i>Waller</i> did often reflect. His Majesty ask&#8217;d the
Bishops, <i>My Lords, cannot I take my Subjects Money when I want it,
without all this Formality in Parliament?</i> The Bishop of <i>Durham</i> readily
answer&#8217;d, <i>God forbid, Sir, but you should; you are the Breath of our
Nostrils</i>. Whereupon the King turn&#8217;d and said to the Bishop of
<i>Winchester</i>, <i>Well, my Lord, what say you? Sir</i>, replied the Bishop, <i>I
have no Skill to judge of Parliamentary Cases</i>. The King answer&#8217;d, <i>No
Put-offs, my Lord; answer me presently. Then, Sir</i>, said he, <i>I think it
is lawful for you to take my Brother</i> Neal<i>&#8217;s</i> <i>Money, for he offers it</i>.
Mr. <i>Waller</i> said the Company was pleas&#8217;d with this Answer, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> Wit
of it seem&#8217;d to affect the King.&#8221; Which shews the exceeding Aptness and
Usefulness of a good <i>Irony</i>; that can convey an Instruction to a vicious,
evil, and tyrannical Prince, highly reflecting on his Conduct, without
drawing on his Resentment.</p>

<p>To these famous Divines I might add the most eminent and renowned
Philosophers of Antiquity, who, either out of a Contempt of Mankind, or to
gratify their peculiar Tempers, or to correct the Vices and Follies of
Men, and to instil virtuous Maxims in those who would only receive them in
some pleasant way, set up for good Humour, Mirth, and Drollery, as their
standing Method of Life, and of Conversation with the World; and have left
behind them some of their occasional Sayings upon record, which do more
Honour to their Memories than the most elaborate Treatises would have
done, and more Good to Men; upon whom a Jest, or witty Saying, is more
fitted to operate and make Impression than long Deductions and Reasonings,
and particularly on Princes and great Men, who will receive no Instruction
but in some very artful and short Way: whereof even the rude <i>Diogenes</i>,
the <i>Cynick</i>, has given us a most incomparable Example, in his occasional
Conference with <i>Alexander the Great</i>, who was put into such Temper by the
mere Freedom and Raillery of the Philosopher, as to take every thing in
good part he said to him, and consequently be dispos&#8217;d to reflect upon it,
and to act with Discretion. At the Head of these Philosophers I place
<span class="smcap">Socrates</span>, who has very generally in all Ages pass&#8217;d for the <i>wisest</i> of
<i>Men</i>, and was declared so by an <i>Oracle</i>; which, at least, was therein
directed and influenc&#8217;d by some considerable human Authority, or by the
common Sentiments of Men at that time. His Character I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> shall give you in
the words of the most ingenious <i>Addison</i>, who was himself a Master of
<i>Humour</i> and <i>Drollery</i>, and practis&#8217;d them in Perfection, and with great
Success in almost all his Prose-writings. &#8220;<i>Socrates</i>, says he<small><a name="f50.1" id="f50.1" href="#f50">[50]</a></small>, who
was the greatest Propagator of Morality in the Heathen World, and a Martyr
for the Unity of the Godhead, was so famous for the exercise of the Talent
[of Raillery and Humour] among the politest People of Antiquity, that he
gain&#8217;d the Name of <span class="smcap">the Drole</span>.<small><a name="f51.1" id="f51.1" href="#f51">[51]</a></small>&#8221; A Character that intitled him to the
greatest Merit, as it most of all enabled him to promote Virtue.</p>

<p>I might also offer to your Confederation the Affair of <i>Comedies</i>; which
all polite Governments have permitted, or establish&#8217;d, in their several
populous and wealthy Cities, as the necessary and proper means to
encounter Vice and recommend Virtue, and to employ innocently and usefully
the vacant Hours of many, who know not how to employ their Time, or would
employ it amiss, by entering into <small><a name="f52.1" id="f52.1" href="#f52">[52]</a></small> Factions and Cabals to disturb the
State; or by Gaming, or by backbiting Conversations about their
Neighbours. And as <i>Comedies</i>, which were originally very gross, grew by
Use more polite and refin&#8217;d in <i>Satire</i> and <i>Raillery</i>: so the most
celebrated Wits and Statesmen, and Persons of the greatest Quality, have
engag&#8217;d and join&#8217;d with others in them, and performed with the greatest
Success and Reputation to themselves; and have been valu&#8217;d, not only for
their Talents of <i>Irony</i> and <i>Drollery</i>, which were essential to the
Credit of such Performances; but applauded, as acting the virtuous Part of <i>Droles</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>In fine, Books of Satire, Wit,
Humour, <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'Rididicule'">Ridicule</ins>, Drollery, and Irony, are
the most read and applauded of all Books, in all Ages, Languages, and
Countries. And as those which are exquisite in their kinds, are the
standing Entertainment of the Ingenious and Learned; so others, of a lower
kind, are to be found among the lower Readers, who sleep under all Works which do not make them merry.</p>

<p>In a word, the Opinions and Practices of Men in all Matters, and
especially in Matters of Religion, are generally so absurd and ridiculous
that it is impossible for them not to be the Subjects of Ridicule.</p>

<p>For what else can be expected from Men who generally take up their
Opinions without any Inquiry into their Reasonableness or Truth, and upon
the most incompetent Grounds? I cannot be supposed to injure Mankind, if I
consider them under the Character which the very ingenious Sir <i>Richard
Steele</i> gives of himself; who <i>acknowledges</i> <small><a name="f53.1" id="f53.1" href="#f53">[53]</a></small> that (even while he took
upon himself the Title of the <i>Censor</i> of <i>Great Britain</i>, and in so many
fine Papers corrects his Countrymen, and particularly <i>the Freethinkers</i>,
whom he directs the Magistrate to punish with Death) <i>it had been with
him, as it is with too many others, that a</i> <small><a href="#f53">[53]</a></small> <i>sort of an</i> implicit
Religion <i>seem&#8217;d the most easy and most comfortable; and that a blind
Veneration for</i> he knew not what, <i>and he</i> knew not whom, <i>stood for every
thing important</i>. And he <i>confesses</i> he <i>was not enough aware, that this
Implicitness of Conduct is the great Engine of Popery, fram&#8217;d for the
Destruction of</i> good Nature, <i>as well as</i> good Sense. If so great a Man
could take up with such a Method, and act the Part of a <i>Censor</i> and
Director<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> of others, in a Matter which he had not at all consider&#8217;d, what
can be expected else from others, but absurd and ridiculous Opinions and Practices?</p>

<p>And if some Men will fall into absurd and ridiculous Opinions, Habits,
Forms, Figures and Grimaces; there will be those who will <i>laugh</i>, nay,
cannot help <i>laughing</i> at them. Hence most Parties laugh at one another,
without the least Scruple, and with great Applause of their own Parties;
and the Leaders of the same Party laugh with one another, when they
consider the absurd and ridiculous Opinions they profess, and how they
cheat and govern their Followers; agreeably to what <i>Cicero</i> reports of
<i>Cato</i><small><a name="f54.1" id="f54.1" href="#f54">[54]</a></small>, &#8220;<i>Vetus autem illud</i> Catonis <i>admodum scitum est, qui</i> mirari
se <i>aiebat, quod non rideret haruspex cum haruspicem vidisset</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>I think it may be justly suppos&#8217;d, that Pope <i>Alexander</i> and <i>Thomas
Becket</i> could not but laugh together at the Simplicity and Weakness of
their Followers, the Papists, who receiv&#8217;d for truth the following Story.
It was told as a Fact<small><a name="f55.1" id="f55.1" href="#f55">[55]</a></small>, &#8220;that when <i>Thomas Becket</i>, who never drank any
thing but Water, sat at Table with <i>Pope Alexander</i>, and that his Holiness
would needs taste of his Cup; lest his abstemiousness should be known, God
turn&#8217;d the Water into Wine: so that the <i>Pope</i> found nothing but Wine in
the Cup. But when <i>Becket</i> pledg&#8217;d him, it was turn&#8217;d into Water again.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Laughing</i> therefore, and <i>Ridicule</i> in <i>serious Matters</i>, go round the
World with no inconsiderable Applause, and seem highly proper for this
World of Nonsense and Folly. To hinder <i>laughing</i> upon such just Occasions
as are given, is almost all one <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>as to hinder <i>breathing</i>. A very witty,
drolling, Dramatick Poet, and of the first Rank for Quality, says in a
<i>Prologue</i> to his Auditors.</p>

<p class="poem">
&#8220;<i>Suppose now, at this Instant, one of you</i><br />
&#8220;<i>Were tickled by a Fool, what would you do?</i><br />
&#8220;<i>&#8217;Tis ten to one you&#8217;d</i> laugh: <i>here&#8217;s just the Case.</i><br />
&#8220;<i>For there are Fools that tickle with their Face.</i><br />
&#8220;<i>Your gay Fool tickles with his Dress and Motions;</i><br />
&#8220;<i>But your</i> grave Fool <i>of</i> Fools <i>with</i> silly Notions.<br />
&#8220;<i>Is it not then unjust that Fops should still</i><br />
&#8220;<i>Force one to</i> laugh, <i>and then take laughing ill?</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II. <i>Secondly</i>, If it be a Fault in those reverend Divines, mention&#8217;d in
the foregoing Article, to use <i>Irony</i>, <i>Drollery</i>, <i>Ridicule</i>, and
<i>Satire</i>, in any Case; or if the Fault lies in an exorbitant Use thereof,
or in any particular Species of <i>Drollery</i>; as, for example, such
<i>Drollery</i> as is to be found in the polemical Writings and Sermons of Dr.
<i>South</i>; it is fit some Remedy should be employ&#8217;d for the Cure of this
Evil. And the Remedy I would propose, should not be to have the Authors
punish&#8217;d by the Magistrate, any more than for any other Faults in writing;
but either to neglect and despise it, as Rage and Scolding, which drop
into Oblivion with the Sound, and would have a Life given it by
Resentment: or to allow Men to <i>criticize</i> and <i>ridicule</i> one another for
their <i>Ironies</i> and <i>Drollery</i>, and to exercise their Wit and Parts
against each other; that being the true Method to bring Things to a
Standard, to fix the Decency and Propriety of Writing, to teach Men how to
write to the Satisfaction of the ingenious, polite, and sensible Part of
Mankind: for Decency and Propriety will stand the Test of Ridicule, and
triumph over all the false Pretences to Wit; and Indecency and
Impropriety<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> will sink under the Trial of Ridicule, as being capable of
being baffled by Reason, and justly ridicul&#8217;d. And if any kind or degree
of <i>Ridicule</i> be absurd or <i>ridiculous</i>, that will appear so upon Trial,
no less than the low and gross <i>Ridicule</i> prevalent among the unpolite
Part of the World: But that will never appear. On the contrary, <i>Ridicule</i>
of certain kinds, and under reasonable Directions and Rules, and used in
proper Time, Place, and Manner, (all which also are only to be found out
and fix&#8217;d by Trial and Experience) is both a proper and necessary Method
of Discourse in many Cases, and especially in the Case of <i>Gravity</i>, when
that is attended with Hypocrisy or Imposture, or with Ignorance, or with
soureness of Temper and Persecution; all which ought to draw after them
the <i>Ridicule</i> and <i>Contempt</i> of the Society, which has no other effectual
Remedy against such Methods of Imposition. And to determine in some
measure the Nature and Extent of the <i>Irony</i> I contend for, as <i>Just</i>, I
profess to approve the noble <i>Sarcasm</i> of <i>Elijah</i><small><a name="f56.1" id="f56.1" href="#f56">[56]</a></small>; wherein he thus
mocks the <i>Priests</i> of <i>Baal</i>, saying in effect to them, &#8220;<i>Cry aloud, for</i>
your <i>Baal</i> is a fine God: <i>He is either talking, or he is pursuing, or he
is in a Journey; or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked</i>.&#8221; And I
concur with the <i>Psalmist</i><small><a name="f57.1" id="f57.1" href="#f57">[57]</a></small>, who thought it no Indecency to say, that
<i>he that sits in Heaven shall laugh them</i> (that is, certain Kings, who
were <i>David</i>&#8217;s Enemies) <i>to scorn; the Lord shall have them in Derision</i>:
and must judge, that <i>laughing to scorn</i>, and <i>deriding</i> the greatest Men
upon Earth, even Kings and Princes, to be a laudable and divine Method of
dealing with them, who are only to be taught or rebuk&#8217;d in some artful
way. I also approve of the following <i>Sarcasm</i> or <i>Irony</i>, which <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>has a
better Authority for it than <i>Elijah</i> or the <i>Psalmist</i>. <i>Moses</i>
introduces God speaking thus after the Fall<small><a name="f58.1" id="f58.1" href="#f58">[58]</a></small>, <i>Behold the Man is become
like one of us, to know Good and Evil!</i> And I think this Passage shews,
that the whole Affair of the <i>Fall</i>, of which we have so very brief an
Account, was a very entertaining Scene; and would have appear&#8217;d so, if set
forth at large; as indeed it does under the Hands of our Divines, who have
supplied that short Narration by various Additions, founded on
Conjectures, and particularly under the fine Hand of Dr. <i>Tho. Burnet</i>,
who has made a most ingenious Dialogue of what he suppos&#8217;d pass&#8217;d between
<i>Eve</i> and the <i>Serpent</i><small><a name="f59.1" id="f59.1" href="#f59">[59]</a></small>. To say nothing of <i>Milton</i>&#8217;s famous <i>Paradise Lost</i>.</p>

<p>In fine, ever since I could read the <i>Bible</i>, I was particularly pleas&#8217;d
with the <i>History</i> of <i>Jonas</i>, where such a Representation is made of that
<i>Prophet</i>&#8217;s Ignorance, Folly, and Peevishness, as exposes him to the
utmost Contempt and Scorn, and fixes a perpetual <i>Ridicule</i> on his
Character. And let me here observe, that this <i>History</i> has had ample
Justice done it, in an Explication thereof by <i>two</i> <small><a name="f60.1" id="f60.1" href="#f60">[60]</a></small> very ingenious
Authors, who, by most penetrating and happy Criticisms and Reflections,
have drawn the Character of <i>Jonas</i> in a more open manner.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III. But, <i>Thirdly</i>, I wave my <i>Remedy</i>, and am ready to come into any Law
that shall be made to rectify this suppos&#8217;d Fault of <i>Irony</i>, by punishing those who are guilty of it.</p>

<p>The great Concern is and ought to be, that <i>the Liberty of examining into
the Truth of Things should be</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> <i>kept up</i>, that Men may have some Sense and
Knowledge, and not be the <i>Dupes</i> of <i>Cheats</i> and <i>Impostors</i>, or of those
who would keep them in the dark, and let them receive nothing but thro&#8217;
their Hands. If that be secur&#8217;d to us by Authority, I, for my part, am
very ready to sacrifice the Privilege of <i>Irony</i>, tho so much in fashion
among all Men; being persuaded, that a great Part of the <i>Irony</i>
complain&#8217;d of, has its rise from the <i>want of Liberty to examine into the
Truth of Things</i>; and that if that <i>Liberty</i> was prevalent, it would,
without a Law, prevent all that <i>Irony</i> which Men are driven into for want
of Liberty to speak plainly, and to protect themselves from the Attacks of
those who would take the Advantage to ruin them for direct Assertions; and
that such Authors as <i>Rabelais</i>, <i>Saint Aldegonde</i>, <i>Blount</i>, <i>Marvel</i>,
<i>Thekeringil</i>, and many others, would never have run into that Excess of
<i>Burlesque</i>, for which they are all so famous, had not the Restraint from
writing <i>seriously</i> been so great.</p>

<p>&#8220;If <small><a name="f61.1" id="f61.1" href="#f61">[61]</a></small> Men are forbid to speak their Minds <i>seriously</i> on certain
Subjects, they will do it <i>ironically</i>. If they are forbid at all upon
such Subjects, or if they find it dangerous to do so, they will then
redouble their Disguise, involve themselves in mysteriousness, and talk so
as hardly to be understood, or at least not plainly interpreted by those
who are dispos&#8217;d to do them a Mischief. And thus <i>Raillery</i> is brought
more in fashion, and runs into an Extreme. &#8217;Tis the persecuting Spirit has
rais&#8217;d the <i>bantering</i> one: And want of Liberty may account for want of a
true Politeness, and for the Corruption or wrong Use of Pleasantry and Humour.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>&#8220;If in this respect we strain the just Measure of what we call <i>Urbanity</i>,
and are apt sometimes to take a buffooning rustick Air, we may thank the
ridiculous Solemnity and sour Humour of our <i>Pedagogues</i>: or rather they
may thank themselves, if they in particular meet with the heaviest of this
kind of Treatment. For it will naturally fall heaviest, where the
Constraint has been the severest. The greater the Weight is, the bitterer
will be the Satire. The higher the Slavery, the more exquisite the Buffoonery.</p>

<p>&#8220;That this is really so, may appear by looking on those Countries where
the spiritual Tyranny is highest. For the greatest of <i>Buffoons</i> are the
<i>Italians</i>: and in their Writings, in their freer sort of Conversations,
on their Theatres, and in their <i>Streets</i>, <i>Buffoonery</i> and <i>Burlesque</i>
are in the highest Vogue. &#8217;Tis the only manner in which the poor cramp&#8217;d
Wretches can discharge a free Thought. We must yield to &#8217;em the
Superiority in this sort of Wit. For what wonder is it if we, who have
more Liberty, have less Dexterity in that egregious way of <i>Raillery</i> and <i>Ridicule</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>Liberty of <i>grave</i> Examination being fix&#8217;d by Law, I am, I say, ready to
sacrifice the Privilege of <i>Irony</i>, and yield to have a Law enacted to
prevent it. I am, moreover, willing to leave the drawing up such a Law to
your self; who honestly and impartially say<small><a name="f62.1" id="f62.1" href="#f62">[62]</a></small>, that all who <i>droll</i>, let
them be of any Party, let them <i>droll for the Truth or against it</i>, should be equally punish&#8217;d.</p>

<p>Thus this grand Affair of <i>Irony</i>, <i>Banter</i>, and <i>Ridicule</i>; this last
persecuting Pretence, upon which you would set the Humours and Passions of
People,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> who are all at quiet, on float, and make a Fermentation, and
raise a Persecution against particular People, seems perfectly settled, by
yielding to your own Terms.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV. Let me here add, that I am apt to think, that when you draw up your
Law, you will find it so very difficult to settle the Point of <i>Decency</i>
in Writing, in respect to all the various kinds of <i>Irony</i> and <i>Ridicule</i>,
that you will be ready to lay aside your Project; and that you will be no
more able to settle that <i>Point of Decency</i>, than you would be to settle
by Law, that <i>Cleanliness</i> in Clothes, and that Politeness in Dress,
Behaviour, and Conversation, which become Men of Quality and Fortune in
the World, and should be habitual to them: And that, if you are able to do
that to your own Satisfaction, you will find it very difficult to engage
the Lawmakers in your Project. For I am persuaded, that if our Lawmakers
were, out of a rational Principle, disposed to give Liberty by Law to
<i>serious</i> Opposition to publickly receiv&#8217;d Notions, they would not think
it of much Importance to make a <i>Law</i> about a Method of <i>Irony</i>. They will
naturally conclude, that if Men may and ought to be allow&#8217;d to write
<i>seriously</i> in Opposition to publickly receiv&#8217;d Doctrines, they should be
allow&#8217;d to write in their own way; and will be unwilling to be depriv&#8217;d of
ingenious and witty Discourses, or such as some of them will judge so,
about a Subject wherein <i>serious free</i> Discourse is allow&#8217;d. Besides, I am
apt to think, that you, upon consideration of the Advantages which the
Church has receiv&#8217;d from the <i>Berkenheads</i>, the <i>Heylins</i>, the <i>Ryves&#8217;s</i>,
the <i>Needhams</i>, the <i>Lestranges</i>, the <i>Nalsons</i>, the <i>Lesleys</i>, the
<i>Oldesworths</i>, and others, in their <i>Mercurius Aulicus</i>&#8217;s, their
<i>Mercurius Pragmaticus&#8217;s</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> their <i>Mercurius Rusticus&#8217;s</i>, their
<i>Observators</i><small><a name="f63.1" id="f63.1" href="#f63">[63]</a></small>, their <i>Heraclitus Ridens</i>&#8217;s, <i>Rehearsals</i>, their
<i>Examiners</i><small><a name="f64.1" id="f64.1" href="#f64">[64]</a></small>, and the three Volumes against the <i>Rights of the Church</i>;
from the <i>Butlers</i> in their <i>Hudibras</i>&#8217;s, and other Burlesque Works upon
the Religion and Religious Conduct of the Dissenters; or from the
<i>Eachards</i>, the <i>Tom Browns</i>, and <i>Swifts</i>; or from the <i>Parkers</i><small><a name="f65.1" id="f65.1" href="#f65">[65]</a></small>,
<i>Patricks</i><small><a name="f66.1" id="f66.1" href="#f66">[66]</a></small>, <i>Souths</i><small><a name="f67.1" id="f67.1" href="#f67">[67]</a></small>,
<i>Sherlocks</i><small><a name="f68.1" id="f68.1" href="#f68">[68]</a></small>, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span><i>Atterburys</i><small><a name="f69.1" id="f69.1" href="#f69">[69]</a></small>, and
<i>Sacheverels</i><small><a name="f70.1" id="f70.1" href="#f70">[70]</a></small>; in their Discourses, and Tracts against the
Nonconformists, Whigs, Low-Church-men, and Latitudinarians; and other such
ironical, satirical, and polemical Divines; and from such <i>drolling</i>
Judges as <i>Howel</i>, <i>Recorder</i> of London, and the Chief Justice <i>Jefferys</i>,
who, in all Causes, where <i>Whigs</i> or Dissenters were the Persons accus&#8217;d
and try&#8217;d before them, carried on the Trial by a <small><a name="f71.1" id="f71.1" href="#f71">[71]</a></small> Train of ridicule on
them, their Witnesses and Counsel: I say, I am apt to think, that you
would be unwilling to be depriv&#8217;d of what has been and may be again so serviceable.</p>

<p>I am dispos&#8217;d to think that Dr. <i>Snape</i>, who is notoriously known to have
gone into the greatest Lengths of Calumny and Satire against Bishop
<i>Hoadley</i><small><a name="f72.1" id="f72.1" href="#f72">[72]</a></small>, to have fall&#8217;n upon the dissenting Clergy in a burlesque
and bantering Address to the <i>Peirces</i>, the <i>Calamys</i>, and the
<i>Bradburys</i>, and to have written a long <i>ironical Letter</i> in the Name of
the <i>Jesuits</i> to Mr. <i>de la Pilloniere</i><small><a name="f73.1" id="f73.1" href="#f73">[73]</a></small>, will be thought a very
improper Object of Censure for such Employment of his Pen. On the
contrary, such sort of Attacks upon such Persons are the most meritorious
Parts of a Man&#8217;s Life, recommend him as a Person of true and sincere
Religion, much more than the strongest Reasoning, and the most regular
Life; and pave the way to all the Riches, and Pleasures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> and Advantages or
Life; not only among those, who, under the Colour of Religion, are
carrying on a common <i>Corporation Cause</i> of Wealth, Power, and Authority,
but among many well-meaning People, who allow of all Practices, which they
suppose help out the <i>Truth</i>! It seems to me a most prodigious Banter upon
us, for Men to talk in general of the <i>Immorality</i> of <i>Ridicule</i> and
<i>Irony</i>, and of <i>punishing</i> Men for those Matters, when their own Practice
is <i>universal Irony</i> and <i>Ridicule</i> of all those who go not with them, and
<i>universal Applause</i> and <i>Encouragement</i> for such <i>Ridicule</i> and <i>Irony</i>,
and distinguishing by all the honourable ways imaginable such <i>drolling</i>
Authors for their Drollery; and when Punishment for <i>Drollery</i> is never
call&#8217;d for, but when <i>Drollery</i> is used or employ&#8217;d against them!</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know whether you would be willing, if you consider of it, to limit
the Stage it self, which has with great Applause and Success, from Queen
<i>Elizabeth</i>&#8217;s Time downwards, ridicul&#8217;d the serious <i>Puritans</i> and
<i>Dissenters</i>, and that without any Complaints from <i>good Churchmen</i>, that
<i>serious</i> Persons and Things were <i>banter&#8217;d</i> and <i>droll&#8217;d</i> upon; and has
triumph&#8217;d over its fanatical Adversaries in the Person of <i>Pryn</i>, who
sufficiently suffer&#8217;d for his <i>Histrio-Mastix</i>, and has been approv&#8217;d of
as an innocent Diversion by the religious Dr. <i>Patrick</i> in his <i>Friendly
Debate</i>, in the Reign of King <i>Charles</i> II. when the Stage was in a very
immoral State. I don&#8217;t know whether you would be willing even to restrain
<i>Bartholomew Fair</i>, where the Sect of the <i>New Prophets</i> was the Subject
of a <i>Droll</i> or <i>Puppet-Show</i>, to the great Satisfaction of the Auditors,
who, it may be presum&#8217;d, were all good Churchmen, <i>Puritans</i> and
<i>Dissenters</i> usually declining such Entertainments out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> of <i>real</i> or
<i>pretended</i> Seriousness. (&#8220;A certain Clergyman thought fit to remark, that
King <i>William</i> could be no good Churchman, because of his not frequenting
the <i>Play-House</i>.&#8221;<small><a name="f74.1" id="f74.1" href="#f74">[74]</a></small>)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V. It will probably be a Motive with you to be against abolishing
<i>Drollery</i>, when you reflect that the Men of <i>Irony</i>, the <i>Droles</i> and
<i>Satirists</i>, have been and always will be very numerous on your side,
where they have been and are so much incourag&#8217;d for acting that Part, and
that they have always been and always will be very few on the side of
<i>Heterodoxy</i>; a Cause wherein an Author by engaging, may hurt his
Reputation and Fortune, and can propose nothing to himself but Poverty and
Disgrace. I doubt whether you would be for punishing your Friend Dr.
<i>Rogers</i>, from whom I just now quoted an <i>Irony</i> on the Author of <i>The
Scheme of Literal Prophecy consider&#8217;d</i>, or any one else, for <i>laughing</i> at
and making sport with him; or whether you would be for punishing the
Reverend Mr. <i>Trapp</i>, who implies the <i>Justness</i> and <i>Propriety of
ridiculing Popery</i>; when he says<small><a name="f75.1" id="f75.1" href="#f75">[75]</a></small>, that <i>Popery is so foolish and
absurd, that every body of common Sense must</i> <span class="smcap">laugh</span> <i>at it</i>; and when he
refers to <i>Erasmus</i> for having <i>abundantly</i> <span class="smcap">ridicul&#8217;d</span> their <i>Reliques</i>;
and himself puts <i>Ridicule</i> in Practice against them, by representing
their Doctrines and Practices as <i>ridiculously foolish</i>, as <i>despicably
childish</i>, and <i>Matter of mere Scorn</i>; as <i>monstrous</i>; as <i>Spells</i>,
<i>juggling Tricks</i>, <i>gross Cheats</i>, <i>Impostures</i><small><a name="f76.1" id="f76.1" href="#f76">[76]</a></small>, and <i>wretched
Shifts</i>; and in fine, in representing by way of <i>Specimen</i>, all their
<i>Miracles</i> as <i>Legends</i>; of which he says, <i>These and a thousand more such
like unreasonable Lies, which a Child of common Sense</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> <i>would laugh at, are
impos&#8217;d upon and swallow&#8217;d by the ignorant People, and make a</i> <span class="smcap">very great</span>
<i>Part of the Popish Religion.</i></p>

<p>And this, in concurrence with Mr. <i>Trapp</i>, I also take to be the Case of
Popery, that it must make Men <i>laugh</i>; and that it is much easier to be
gravely disposed in reading a <i>Stage-Comedy</i> or <i>Farce</i>, than in
considering and reflecting on the <i>Comedy</i> and <i>Farce</i> of <i>Popery</i>; than
which, Wit and Folly, and Madness in conjunction, cannot invent or make a
thing more ridiculous, according to that Light in which I see their
Doctrines, Ceremonies and Worship, the Histories and Legends of their
Saints, and the pretended Miracles wrought in their Church; which has
hardly any thing <i>serious</i> in it but its Persecutions, its Murders, its
Massacres; all employ&#8217;d against the most innocent and virtuous, and the
most sensible and learned Men, because they will not be <i>Tools</i> to support
Villany and Ignorance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Transubstantiation, says <i>Tillotson</i><small><a name="f77.1" id="f77.1" href="#f77">[77]</a></small>, is not a Controversy of
Scripture against Scripture, or of Reason against Reason, but of downright
Impudence against the plain meaning of Scripture, and all the Sense and
Reason of Mankind.&#8221; And accordingly he scruples not to say, in a most
<i>drolling</i> manner, that &#8220;Transubstantiation is one of the chief of the
<i>Roman</i> Church&#8217;s <i>legerdemain</i> and <i>juggling Tricks</i> of Falshood and
Imposture; and that in all Probability those common juggling Words of
<i>Hocus-pocus</i>, are nothing else but a Corruption of <i>hoc est corpus</i>, by
way of ridiculous Imitation of the Church of <i>Rome</i> in their <i>Trick</i> of
<i>Transubstantiation</i>.&#8221; And as he <i>archly</i> makes the Introduction of this
monstrous Piece of <i>grave Nonsense</i> to be owing to its being at first
preach&#8217;d by its Promoters with <i>convenient Gravity and</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
<i>Solemnity</i><small><a name="f78.1" id="f78.1" href="#f78">[78]</a></small>,
which is the common Method of imposing Absurdities on the World; so I
think that Doctrine taught with such <i>convenient Gravity and Solemnity</i>
should necessarily produce <i>Levity, Laughter and Ridicule</i>, in all
intelligent People to whom it is propos&#8217;d, who must <i>smile</i>, if they can
with safety, to see such Stuff vented with a grave Face.</p>

<p>In like manner many other Divines treat and laugh at <i>Popery</i>. Even the
solemn and grave Dr. <i>Whitby</i> has written a Book against
<i>Transubstantiation</i>, under the Title of &#8220;Irrisio Dei Panarii, <i>The
Derision of the Breaden God</i>,&#8221; in Imitation of the primitive Fathers, who
have written <i>Derisions</i> and <i>Mockeries</i> of the <i>Pagan</i> Religion.</p>

<p>And he takes the Materials whereof this drolling Performance of his
consists, from the <i>holy Scriptures</i>, the <i>Apocryphal Books</i>, and
<i>Writings</i> of the <i>holy Fathers</i>, as he tells us in his Title-Page; three
inexhaustible Sources of Wit and Irony against the Corrupters of true and
genuine Religion. In like manner he turns upon the Popish Clergy the
several Arguments urg&#8217;d by the <i>Jewish</i> Clergy in the <i>New Testament</i>, for
the Authority of the <i>Jewish</i> Church; and answers, under that <i>Irony</i>, all
that the Popish Clergy offer in behalf of the <i>Authority</i> of their
<i>Church</i>, in a <i>Sermon</i> at the End of his <i>Annotations</i> on St. <i>John</i>&#8217;s <i>Gospel</i>.</p>

<p>Nor do our Divines confine their <i>Derisions</i>, <i>Ridicule</i> and <i>Irony</i>
against <i>Popery</i> to their Treatises and Discourses, but fill their
<i>Sermons</i>, and especially their <i>Sermons</i> on the <i>Fifth</i> of <i>November</i>,
and other political <i>Days</i>, with infinite Reflections of that Kind. Of
these <i>Reflections</i> a Popish Author publish&#8217;d a <i>Specimen</i>, in a Book
intitled<small><a name="f79.1" id="f79.1" href="#f79">[79]</a></small>, <i>Good Advice</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span><i>to Pulpits</i>, in order to shame the Church out
of their Method of <i>drolling</i> and <i>laughing</i> <small><a name="f80.1" id="f80.1" href="#f80">[80]</a></small> at <i>Popery</i>. But this
Book had no other effect, than to produce a <i>Defence</i> of those <i>Sermons</i>
under the Title of <i>Pulpit Popery true Popery</i>, vindicating the several
<i>Droll</i> Representations made of <i>Popery</i> in those <i>Sermons</i>.</p>

<p>Of these <i>drolling</i> Reflections cited by the Popish Author out of our
Church of <i>England Sermons</i>, take these following for a Specimen of what
are to be met with in those <i>Sermons</i><small><a name="f81.1" id="f81.1" href="#f81">[81]</a></small>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pilgrimages, going Bare-foot, Hair-shirts, and Whips, with other such
Gospel-artillery, are their only Helps to Devotion.&mdash;&mdash;It seems that with
them a Man sometimes cannot be a Penitent, unless he also turns Vagabond,
and foots it to <i>Jerusalem</i>.&mdash;&mdash;He that thinks to expiate a Sin by going
bare-foot, does the Penance of a Goose, and only makes one Folly the
Atonement of another. <i>Paul</i> indeed was scourg&#8217;d and beaten by the <i>Jews</i>;
but we never read that he beat or scourg&#8217;d himself; and if they think his
keeping under his Body imports so much, they must first prove that the
Body cannot be kept under by a virtuous Mind, and that the Mind cannot be
made virtuous but by a Scourge; and consequently, that Thongs and Whipcord
are Means of Grace, and Things necessary to Salvation. The truth is, if
Mens Religion lies no deeper than their Skin, it is possible they may
scourge themselves into very great Improvements.&mdash;&mdash;But they will find
that bodily Exercise touches not the Soul; and consequently that in this
whole Course they are like Men out of the way: let them flash on never so
fast, they <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>are not at all nearer their Journey&#8217;s-end: And howsoever they
deceive themselves and others, they may as well expect to bring a Cart, as a Soul, to Heaven.</p>

<p>&#8220;What say you to the Popish Doctrine of the <i>Sacrifice of the
Mass</i>.&mdash;&mdash;According to this Doctrine, our blessed Saviour must still, to
the end of the World, be laid hold on by Sinners, be ground with their
Teeth, and sent down into their impure Paunches, as often as the Priest
shall pronounce this Charm, <i>hoc est corpus meum</i>: and it seems that he
was a false Prophet, when he said upon the Cross, <i>It is finish&#8217;d</i>, seeing
there was such an infinite deal of <i>loathsom Drudgery</i> still to be undergone.</p>

<p>&#8220;For <i>Purgatory</i>, &#8217;tis not material in it self, whether it be, or where it
be, no more than the World in the Moon; but so long as that false Fire
serves to maintain a true one, and his Holiness&#8217;s Kitchen smokes with the
Rents he receives for releasing Souls from thence, which never came there,
it concerns him and his to see to it, that it be not suffer&#8217;d to go out.&#8221;</p>

<p>An ingenious Author, Sir <i>Richard Steel</i>, has of late made a <i>Dedication</i>
to his <i>Holiness</i> the <i>Pope</i> himself, before a Book entitled, <i>An Account
of the State of the Roman Catholick Religion throughout the World</i>, &amp;c. In
which <i>Dedication</i>, that most exalted Clergyman the <i>Pope</i>, that
[suppos&#8217;d] infallible Dictator in Religion, and most grave Person; who, if
<i>serious</i> Matters and Persons were always to be treated <i>seriously</i>, may
vie with any other Mortal for a Right to <i>serious</i> Treatment; is expos&#8217;d
by incomparable <i>Drollery</i> and <i>Irony</i> to the utmost Contempt, to the
universal Satisfaction of Protestant Readers, who have been pleas&#8217;d to see
a gross Impostor, however<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> respected and ador&#8217;d by godly and serious
Papists, so treated.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI. In fine, it is suited to the common Practice of this Nation to
ridicule <i>Popery</i> as well as <i>Nonconformity</i>; and tho several <i>grave</i>
Books, written among us against Popery, in the Reign of King <i>James</i> II.
(of which yet the <i>Romish</i> Priests complain&#8217;d, as treating the King&#8217;s <small><a name="f82.1" id="f82.1" href="#f82">[82]</a></small>
<i>Religion</i> with Contempt) were then very well receiv&#8217;d and applauded for
Learning and strength of Arguing; yet, I believe, it may with more
Propriety be said, that King <i>James</i> II. and <i>Popery</i> were <small><a name="f83.1" id="f83.1" href="#f83">[83]</a></small> <i>laugh&#8217;d</i>
or <i>Lilli-bullero&#8217;d</i>, than that they were <i>argu&#8217;d</i> out of the Kingdom.</p>

<p>The reading the <i>King&#8217;s Declaration of Indulgence</i> in Churches 1688, had
this fatal <i>Jest</i> put upon it by a reverend Divine, &#8220;Who pleasantly told
his People, <i>That tho he was obliged to read it, they were not obliged to
hear it</i><small><a name="f84.1" id="f84.1" href="#f84">[84]</a></small>; and stop&#8217;d till they all went out, and then he read it to
the Walls.&#8221; To which may be added, the famous Mr. <i>Wallop</i>&#8217;s excellent
Comparison of that <i>Declaration</i> upon the Instant of its Publication, to
<i>the scaffolding of St.</i> Paul<i>&#8217;s Church; which, as soon as the Building
was finish&#8217;d, would be pull&#8217;d down</i>.</p>

<p>Bishop <i>Burnet</i> celebrates, with the greatest Justness, our Taste, and
indeed the Taste of the World in this Respect, when he relates how
<i>Popery</i> was then used among us; and he recites some of the <i>Jests</i> which
passed and were received with universal Applause. He tells us<small><a name="f85.1" id="f85.1" href="#f85">[85]</a></small>, &#8220;The
Court was now (that is, in 1686,) much set on making Converts, which
fail&#8217;d in most Instances, and produc&#8217;d <i>Repartees</i>; that whether true or
false, were much repeated, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>and were heard with great Satisfaction. The
Earl of <i>Mulgrave</i> (since Duke of <i>Buckinghamshire</i>) was Lord Chamberlain;
he was apt to comply in every thing that he thought might be acceptable,
for he went with the King to Mass, and kneeled at it; and being look&#8217;d on
as indifferent to all Religions, the Priests made an Attack upon him: He
heard them <i>gravely</i> arguing for <i>Transubstantiation</i>. He told them he was
willing to receive Instruction; he had taken much Pains to bring himself
to believe in God, who made the World and all Men in it: But it must not
be an ordinary Force of Argument that could make him believe that Man was
quits with God, and made God again. The Earl of <i>Middleton</i> had marry&#8217;d
into a Popish Family, and was a Man of great Parts and a generous Temper,
but of loose Principles in Religion; so a Priest was sent to instruct him.
He began with <i>Transubstantiation</i>, of which he said he would convince him
immediately: And began thus, You believe the <i>Trinity</i>. <i>Middleton</i> stop&#8217;d
him, and said, who told you so? At which he seem&#8217;d amazed. So the Earl
said, he expected he should convince him of his Belief, but not question
him of his own: With this the Priest was so disorder&#8217;d, that he could
proceed no farther. One Day the King gave the Duke of <i>Norfolk</i> the Sword
of State to carry before him to the Chappel, and he stood at the Door.
Upon which the King said to him, My Lord, your Father would have gone
farther. To which the Duke answer&#8217;d, Your Majesty&#8217;s Father was the better
Man, and he would not have gone so far. <i>Kirk</i> was also spoken to, to
change his Religion, and he reply&#8217;d briskly, that he was already
pre-engag&#8217;d, for <i>he had promised the King of</i> Morocco, <i>that if ever</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
<i>he chang&#8217;d his Religion he would turn</i> Mahometan.&#8221; When K. <i>James</i> sent an
<i>Irish</i> Priest to convert the D. of <i>Bucks</i> [<i>Villers</i>] the said Duke
entertain&#8217;d the Priest with a Bottle, and engag&#8217;d him in a <i>Dialogue</i>,
which the Duke afterwards caus&#8217;d to be printed, to the no small
Mortification of all Papists, who were therein exceedingly ridicul&#8217;d, and
to the Triumph of all good Churchmen, who are never better pleas&#8217;d, than
when they have the <i>Laugh</i> on their side.</p>

<p>At this time also were publish&#8217;d two merry Books, by a couple of our
Divines, with express View to make Protestants laugh at <i>Popery</i>, as at a
<i>Farce</i>; and they were, <i>The School of the Eucharist</i>, wherein is a
Collection of ridiculous <i>Miracles</i>, pretended to be wrought to support
the Truth of <i>Transubstantiation</i>, and <i>Purgatory prov&#8217;d by Miracles</i>.</p>

<p>I must not omit another incomparable Piece of Wit and Raillery against
<i>Popery</i>, publish&#8217;d at that time. It seems the famous Poet, <i>Dryden</i>,
thought fit to declare himself a <i>Roman Catholick</i>; and had, as &#8217;tis said,
a <i>Penance</i> injoyn&#8217;d him by his Confessor, for having formerly written
<i>The Spanish Fryar</i>, of composing some <i>Treatise</i> in a <i>poetical way</i> for
<i>Popery</i>, and against the <i>Reformation</i>. This he executed in a <i>Poem</i>,
intituled, <i>The Hind and Panther</i>; which, setting aside the Absurdity of
the Matters therein asserted, and of the several Arguments to maintain
them, is, in other Respects, one of the most mean Compositions that ever
the Press produc&#8217;d. Was it proper to pass over in silence such a Work,
from whence probably the Popish Party expected great Matters, as knowing
the Efficacy of Poetry, and being Witnesses of the Success the Author had
had in his <i>Absalom</i> and <i>Achitophel</i> against the <i>Whigs</i>? Was it proper
to write <i>seriously</i> and <i>gravely</i> against a Book, wherein the Author
every where aims at Wit, Irony, and Burlesque, and does himself make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> so
ridiculous a Figure, as to be a standing Jest throughout the whole? Was
not the Convert himself, as such, a <i>Jest</i>, or as professing any Religion,
a <i>Jest</i>; who argu&#8217;d for Pay, and spoke as he was brib&#8217;d, and would have
profess&#8217;d any Opinions, as is the Mode and Practice of the World, to which
Salary and Preferments are annexed? Some ingenious Persons of the Times
took a better Method, and agreeably to the Temper and Disposition of our
Countrymen, and to the nature of <i>Dryden</i>&#8217;s Attack, and his interested
Writing for Religion, made a Return in a Paper intituled, <i>The Hind and
Panther transvers&#8217;d to the Story of the Country-Mouse and City-Mouse</i>: Out
of which, for a Specimen of <i>just Irony</i>, and <i>fine Raillery</i>, I will give you the following Passage.</p>

<p class="poem">
&#8220;<i>Sirrah, says</i> Brindle, <i>thou hast brought us</i> Wine,<br />
&#8220;<i>Sour to my Taste, and to my Eyes unfine.</i><br />
&#8220;<i>Says</i> Will, <i>All Gentlemen like it. Ah! says</i> White,<br />
&#8220;<i>What is approved by them must needs be right.</i><br />
&#8220;<i>&#8217;Tis true, I thought it bad, but if the</i> House<br />

&#8220;<i>Be allow&#8217;d to have an understanding</i> Taste?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VII. I question whether High-Church would be willing to have the reverend
Author of the <i>Tale of a Tub</i>, one of the greatest <i>Droles</i> that ever
appear&#8217;d upon the Stage of the World, punish&#8217;d for that or any other of
his <i>drolling</i> Works: For tho religious Matters, and all the various Forms
of Christianity have therein a considerable Share of <i>Ridicule</i>; yet in
regard of his <i>Drollery</i> upon the <i>Whigs</i>, <i>Dissenters</i>, and the <i>War</i>
with <i>France</i> (things of as <i>serious</i> and weighty Consideration, and as
much affecting the Peace of Society, as <i>Justification</i> by <i>Faith only</i>,
<i>Predestination</i>, <i>Transubstantiation</i>, or <i>Constansubstantiation</i>, or
<i>Questions</i> about <i>religious Ceremonies</i>, or any such interested Matters)
the <i>Convocation</i> in their famous <i>Representation</i> of the <i>Profaneness</i>
and <i>Blasphemy</i> of the Nation, took no notice of his <i>drolling</i> on
Christianity: And his Usefulness in <i>Drollery</i> and <i>Ridicule</i> was deem&#8217;d
sufficient by the <i>Pious</i> Queen <i>Anne</i>, and her <i>pious Ministry</i>, to
intitle him to a Church Preferment of several hundred Pounds <i>per Ann.</i>
<small><a name="f87.1" id="f87.1" href="#f87">[87]</a></small> which she bestow&#8217;d upon him, notwithstanding a <i>fanatick
High-Churchman</i>, who weakly thought <i>Seriousness</i> in Religion of more use
to High-Church than <i>Drollery</i>, and attempted to hinder his Promotion, by
representing to her Majesty, &#8220;What a Scandal it would be both to Church
and State to bestow Preferment upon a Clergyman, who was hardly suspected
of being a Christian.&#8221; Besides, High-Church receives daily most signal
Services from his drolling Capacity, which has of late exerted itself on
the Jacobite Stage of <i>Mist</i>&#8217;s <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>and <i>Fogg</i>&#8217;s Journal, and in other little
Papers publish&#8217;d in <i>Ireland</i>; in which he endeavours to expose the
present Administration of publick Affairs to contempt, to inflame the
<i>Irish</i> Nation against the <i>English</i>, and to make them throw off all
Subjection to the <i>English</i> Government, to satirize Bishop <i>Burnet</i> and
other <i>Whig</i> Bishops; and, in fine, to pave the way for a new or Popish
Revolution, as far as choosing the most proper Topicks of Invective, and
treating of them in the way of <i>Drollery</i>, can do.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VIII. It is well known, that Gravity, Preciseness, Solemnity, Sourness,
formal Dress and Behaviour, Sobriety of Manners, keeping at a distance
from the common Pastimes of the World, Aversion to Rites and Ceremonies in
the publick Worship, and to Pictures, Images, and Musick in Churches;
mixing Religion in common Conversion, using long Graces, practising
Family-Worship, part of which was praying <i>ex tempore</i>; setting up and
hearing Lectures, and a strict Observation of the Lord&#8217;s Day, which was
call&#8217;d the <i>Sabbath</i>, were the Parts of the Character of a <i>Puritan</i>; who,
it is to be observ&#8217;d, usually had the Imputation of Hypocrisy for his
great and extraordinary Pretences to Religion: He was also a great Opposer
of the Court-Measures in the Reign of King <i>James</i> and King <i>Charles</i> I.
and most zealous for Law, Liberty, and Property, when those two Princes
set up for raising Money by their own Authority, and in consequence
thereof, fell into numerous other Acts of Violence and Injustice. It is
also well known, that to quell these Puritans, and lessen their Credit,
and baffle all their Pretences, Gaiety, Mirth, Pastimes or Sports, were
incourag&#8217;d and requir&#8217;d on <i>Sundays</i> of the People, that Churches were
render&#8217;d<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> gay, theatrical, and pleasant by the Decorations, Paintings,
Musick, and Ceremonies therein perform&#8217;d<small><a name="f88.1" id="f88.1" href="#f88">[88]</a></small>; and that the utmost Ridicule
was employ&#8217;d against some of them, as <i>Enthusiasts</i>, and against others of
them as <i>Hypocrites</i>, and against them all as factious and seditious, by
their Adversaries; who were under no Restraints, but incourag&#8217;d to write
with Scorn, Contempt, Raillery and Satire against these suppos&#8217;d Enemies
of Church and State. Nor did the great Success of the <i>Puritans</i> in the
Field of Battle suppress that <i>Vein</i> and <i>Humour</i> of <i>Ridicule</i> begun
against them; but the <i>Laudean</i> Party still carry&#8217;d on a Paper War with
innumerable Pamphlets, which all tended more or less to make the World
<i>laugh</i> at and <i>ridicule</i> the <i>Puritans</i>. And I am verily persuaded, that
no History of any other Country in the World can produce a Parallel,
wherein the Principle and Practice of <i>Ridicule</i> were ever so strongly
encourag&#8217;d, and so constantly pursu&#8217;d, fix&#8217;d and rooted in the Minds of
Men, as it was and is in Churchmen against Puritans and Dissenters. Even
at this Day the <i>Ridicule</i> is so strong against the present Dissenters, so
promoted by Clergy and Laity, especially in Villages and small Country
Towns, that they are unable to withstand its Force, but daily come over in
Numbers to the Church to avoid being <i>laugh&#8217;d</i> at. It seems to me a Mark
of Distinction more likely to last in the Church than any other Matter
that I can observe. Passive Obedience, the divine Right of Kings, <i>&amp;c.</i>
rise and fall according to particular <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>Occasions; but <i>Laughter</i> at
<i>Dissenters</i> seems fixt for ever, if they should chance to last so long.</p>

<p><i>South</i>&#8217;s Sermons, which now amount to <i>six Volumes</i>, make Reading <i>Jests</i>
and <i>Banter</i> upon <i>Dissenters</i>, the religious Exercise of good Churchmen
upon <i>Sundays</i>, who now can serve God (as many think they do by hearing or
reading Sermons) and be as merry as at the Play-house. And <i>Hudibras</i>,
which is a daily High-Church Entertainment, and a Pocket and Travelling
High-Church Companion, must necessarily have a very considerable Effect,
and cannot fail forming in Men that Humour and Vein of <i>Ridicule</i> upon
<i>Dissenters</i> which runs thro&#8217; that Work. In a word, High-Church has
constantly been an Enemy to, and a Ridiculer of the <i>Seriousness</i> of
<i>Puritans</i> and <i>Dissenters</i>, whom they have ever charg&#8217;d with <i>Hypocrisy</i>
for their <i>Seriousness</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;After <small><a name="f89.1" id="f89.1" href="#f89">[89]</a></small> the Civil War had broke out in 1641, and the King and Court
had settled at <i>Oxford</i>, one <i>Birkenhead</i>, who had liv&#8217;d in <i>Laud</i>&#8217;s
Family, and been made Fellow of <i>All Souls College</i> by <i>Laud</i>&#8217;s Means, was
appointed to write a Weekly Paper under the Title of <i>Mercurius Aulicus</i>;
the first whereof was publish&#8217;d in 1642. In the Absence of the Author,
<i>Birkenhead</i>, from <i>Oxford</i>, it was continued by <i>Heylin</i>. <i>Birkenhead</i>
pleas&#8217;d the Generality of Readers with his <i>Waggeries</i> and <i>Buffooneries</i>;
and the Royal Party were so taken with it, that the Author was recommended
to be Reader of <i>Moral Philosophy</i> by his Majesty;&#8221; who, together with the
religious Electors, it is justly to be presum&#8217;d, thought <i>Waggery</i> and
<i>Buffoonery</i>, not only Political, but <i>Religious</i> and <i>Moral</i>, when
employ&#8217;d against <i>Puritans</i> and <i>Dissenters</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>IX. King <i>Charles</i> the Second&#8217;s Restoration brought along with it glorious
<i>High-Church</i> Times; which were distinguish&#8217;d as much by <i>laughing</i> at
<i>Dissenters</i>, as by persecuting them; which pass for a Pattern how
Dissenters are to be treated; and which will never be given up, by
<i>High-Church-men</i>, as faulty, for ridiculing Dissenters.</p>

<p>The King himself, who had very good natural Parts, and a Disposition to
banter and ridicule every Body, and especially the <i>Presbyterians</i>, whose
Discipline he had felt for his Lewdness and Irreligion in <i>Scotland</i>, had
in his <i>Exile</i> an Education, and liv&#8217;d, among some of the greatest
<i>Droles</i> and <i>Wits</i> that any Age ever produc&#8217;d; who could not but form him
in that way, who was so well fitted by Temper for it. The Duke of
<i>Buckingham</i> was his constant Companion. And he had a <small><a name="f90.1" id="f90.1" href="#f90">[90]</a></small> <i>great
Liveliness of Wit, and a peculiar Faculty of turning all things into
ridicule</i>. He was Author of the <i>Rehearsal</i>; which, as a most noble Author
says, is <small><a name="f91.1" id="f91.1" href="#f91">[91]</a></small> <i>a justly admir&#8217;d Piece of comick Wit</i>, and <i>has furnish&#8217;d
our best Wits in all their Controversies, even in Religion and Politicks,
as well as in the Affairs of Wit and Learning, with the most effectual and
entertaining Method of exposing Folly, Pedantry, false Reason, and ill
Writing</i>. The Duke of <i>Buckingham</i> <small><a name="f92.1" id="f92.1" href="#f92">[92]</a></small> brought <i>Hobbes</i> to him to be his
<i>Tutor</i>, who was a <i>Philosophical Drole</i>, and had a great deal of <i>Wit</i> of
the <i>drolling</i> kind. <i>Sheldon</i>, who was afterwards Archbishop of
<i>Canterbury</i>, and attended the King constantly in his Exile as his
<i>Chaplain</i>, was an eminent <i>Drole</i>, as appears from Bishop <i>Burnet</i>, who
says<small><a name="f93.1" id="f93.1" href="#f93">[93]</a></small>, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>that
<i>he had a great Pleasantness of Conversation, perhaps too great</i>.</p>

<p>And <i>Hide</i>, afterwards Earl of <i>Clarendon</i>, who attended the King in his
Exile, seems also to have been a great Drole, by Bishop <i>Burnet</i>&#8217;s
representing him, as one, that <i>had too much Levity in his Wit, and that
did not observe the Decorum of his Post</i><small><a name="f94.1" id="f94.1" href="#f94">[94]</a></small>. In a <i>Speech</i> to the Lords
and Commons, <i>Hide</i> attack&#8217;d the Gravity of the Puritans, saying<small><a name="f95.1" id="f95.1" href="#f95">[95]</a></small>,
&#8220;Very merry Men have been very godly Men; and if a good Conscience be a
continued Feast, there is no reason but Men may be very merry at it.&#8221; And
upon Mr. <i>Baxter</i> and other Presbyterian Ministers waiting on him in
relation to the <i>Savoy Conference</i>, he said to Mr. <i>Baxter</i> on the first
Salute<small><a name="f96.1" id="f96.1" href="#f96">[96]</a></small>, that if &#8220;he were but as fat as Dr. <i>Manton</i>, we should all do well.&#8221;</p>

<p>No wonder therefore, that <i>Ridicule</i>, and <i>Raillery</i>, and <i>Satire</i>, should
prevail at Court after the <i>Restoration</i>; and that King <i>Charles</i> the
Second, who was a Wit himself, and early taught to laugh at his <i>Father&#8217;s
Stiffness</i><small><a name="f97.1" id="f97.1" href="#f97">[97]</a></small>, should be so great a Master of them, and bring them into
play among his Subjects; and that he who had the most sovereign Contempt
for all Mankind, and in particular for the People and Church of <i>England</i>,
should use his Talent against them; and that his People in return should give him like for like.</p>

<p>It is well known how he banter&#8217;d the Presbyterian Ministers, who out of
Interest came over to him at <i>Breda</i>; where they were placed in a Room
next to his Majesty, and order&#8217;d to attend till his Majesty had done his
Devotions; who, it seems, pray&#8217;d so artfully, and poured out so many of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>their Phrases, which he had learned when he was in <i>Scotland</i>, where he
was forced to be present at religious Exercises of six or seven Hours
a-day; and had practis&#8217;d among the <i>Huguenot</i> Ministers in <i>France</i><small><a name="f98.1" id="f98.1" href="#f98">[98]</a></small>,
who reported him to have a <i>sanctify&#8217;d Heart</i>, and to <i>speak the very
Language of</i> Canaan. This <i>Ridicule</i> he <i>cover&#8217;d</i> with <i>Seriousness</i>;
having at that time Occasion for those Ministers, who were then his great
Instruments in reconciling the Nation to his <i>Restoration</i>. When he had no
farther Occasion for them, he was open in his <i>Ridicule</i>, and would say,
that <small><a name="f99.1" id="f99.1" href="#f99">[99]</a></small> <i>Presbyterianism was not a Religion for a Gentleman</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>X. Would you, who are a Man of Sense and Learning, and of some Moderation,
be for punishing the Author of <i>The Difficulties and Discouragements which
attend the Study of the Scriptures in the way of private Judgment</i>, &amp;c.
who is suppos&#8217;d to be a Prelate of the Church, for that Book, which is
wholly an <i>Irony</i> about the most sacred Persons and Things? Must not the
fine <i>Irony</i> it self, and the Execution of it, with so much Learning,
Sense, and Wit, raise in you the highest Esteem and Admiration of the
Author, instead of a Disposition to punish him? Would you appear to the
intelligent Part of the World such an Enemy to Knowledge, and such a
Friend to the Kingdom of Darkness, as such Punishment would imply? In
fine, can you see and direct us to a better way, to make us inquire after
and understand Matters of Religion, to make us get and keep a good temper
of Mind, and to plant and cultivate in us the Virtues necessary to good
Order and Peace in Society, and to eradicate <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>the Vices that every where
give Society so much Disturbance, than what is prescrib&#8217;d or imply&#8217;d in
that Book? And can you think of a better <i>Form</i> of <i>Conveyance</i>, or
<i>Vehicle</i> for Matters of such universal Concern to all intelligent People
(if you consider the State of the World, and the infinite Variety of
Understandings, Interests, and Designs of Men, who are all to be address&#8217;d
to at the same Time) than his Method of <i>Irony</i>? And has not Success
justify&#8217;d his Method? For the Book has had a free Vent in several
Impressions; has been very generally read and applauded; has convinced
Numbers, and has been no Occasion of trouble either to Bookseller or
Author. It has also had the Advantage to have a most ingenious <i>Letter</i> of
<i>John Hales</i> of <i>Eton</i> join&#8217;d to some Editions of it; who by this
<i>Letter</i>, as well as by several others of his Pieces, shews himself to
have been another <i>Socrates</i>, one of the greatest Masters of <i>true Wit</i>
and <i>just Irony</i>, as well as Learning, which the World ever produc&#8217;d; and
shews he could have writ such a Book as the <i>Difficulties</i>, &amp;c. But if you
are capable of coming into any Measures for punishing the Author of the
<i>Difficulties</i>, &amp;c. for his <i>Irony</i>, I conceive, that you may possibly
hesitate a little in relation to the same Author, about his <i>New Defence
of the Bishop of</i> Bangor<i>&#8217;s Sermon of the Kingdom of Christ, consider&#8217;d as
it is the Performance of a Man of Letters</i>; which, tho far below <i>The
Difficulties</i>, &amp;c. is an ingenious <i>Irony</i> on that <i>Sermon</i>. You may
probably, like many others of the Clergy, approve of Satire so well
employ&#8217;d, as against that Bishop, who has succeeded Bishop <i>Burnet</i> in
being the Subject of <i>Clergy-Ridicule</i>, as well as in his Bishoprick. The
Bishop himself was very justly patient, under all Attacks by the Reverend
<i>Trapp</i>, <i>Earbery</i>, <i>Snape</i>, <i>Law</i>, and <i>Luke Milbourne</i>, in his <i>Tom of
Bedlam&#8217;s Answer</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> <i>to his Brother</i> Ben Hoadley, <i>St.</i> Peter<i>&#8217;s</i> Poor <i>Parson
near the Exchange of Principles</i>; some of which were of a very abusive
kind, and such as can hardly be parallel&#8217;d; and did not call upon the
Magistrate to come to his Aid against that Author, or against any others
of the Clergy who had attack&#8217;d him with as great Mockery, Ridicule, and
Irony, as ever Bishop had been by the profess&#8217;d Adversaries of the Order;
or as ever the Bishops had been by the <i>Puritans</i> and <i>Libellers</i> in the
Reigns of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, King <i>James</i> and King <i>Charles</i> the First; or
as <i>Lesley</i>, <i>Hickes</i>, <i>Hill</i>, <i>Atterbury</i>, <i>Binks</i>, and other High-Church
Clergy, did the late Bishop <i>Burnet</i>. Instead of that he took the true and
proper Method, by publishing an <i>Answer</i> to the said <i>Irony</i>, compos&#8217;d in
the same <i>ironical Strain</i>, intitled, <i>The Dean of</i> Worcester <i>still the
same: Or his new Defence of the Bishop of</i> Bangor<i>&#8217;s Sermon, consider&#8217;d,
as it is the Performance of a great Critick, a Man of Sense, and a Man of
Probity</i>. Which Answer does, in my Opinion, as much Honour to the Bishop,
by its Excellency in the <i>ironical Way</i>, as it does by allowing the Method
it self, and going into that Method, in imitation of his Reverend Brethren
of the Clergy, who appear to be under no Restraints from the <i>Immorality</i>
or <i>Indecency</i> of treating the Bishop in the way of Ridicule and with the
utmost Contempt; but, on the contrary, to be spurr&#8217;d on by the
<i>Excellency</i> and <i>Propriety</i> thereof to use it against him, even in the
<small><a name="f100.1" id="f100.1" href="#f100">[100]</a></small> <i>Pulpit</i>, as Part of the religious Exercise on the <i>Lord&#8217;s-day</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XI. There is an universal Love and Practice of <i>Drollery</i> and <i>Ridicule</i>
in all, even the most <i>serious</i> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>Men, in the most <i>serious Places</i>, and on
the most <i>serious Occasions</i>. Go into the Privy-Councils of Princes, into
Senates, into Courts of Judicature, and into the Assemblies of the Kirk or
Church; and you will find that Wit, good Humour, Ridicule, and Drollery,
mix themselves in all the Questions before those Bodies; and that the most
solemn and sour Person there present, will ever be found endeavouring, at
least, to crack his Jest, in order to raise a Character for Wit; which has
so great an Applause attending it, and renders Men so universally
acceptable for their Conversation, and places them above the greatest
Proficients in the Sciences, that almost every one is intoxicated with the Passion of aiming at it.</p>

<p>In the Reports made to us of the Debates in the Houses of Lords, Commons,
and Convocation, the serious Parts of the Speeches there made die for the
most part with the Sound; but the Wit, the Irony, the Drollery, the
Ridicule, the Satire, and Repartees, are thought worthy to be remember&#8217;d
and repeated in Conversation, and make a Part of the History of the
Proceedings of those Bodies, no less than their grave Transactions, as some such must necessarily be.</p>

<p>Whoever will look into Antiquity for an Account of the Lives, Actions, and
Works of the old Philosophers, will find little remaining of them; but
some of their witty, drolling, and bantering Sayings, which alone have
been thought worthy to be preserv&#8217;d to Posterity. And if you will look
into the Lives of the modern Statesmen, Philosophers, Divines, Lawyers,
<i>&amp;c.</i> you will find that their witty Sayings ever make a considerable
Part: by reporting which great Honour is intended to be done to their
Memory. The great and most religious Philosopher Dr. <i>H. More</i>, has a
great many Pieces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> of Wit attributed to him in his <i>Life</i> by Mr. <i>Ward</i>,
who represents him from his Companions, <small><a name="f101.1" id="f101.1" href="#f101">[101]</a></small> <i>as one of the merriest
Greeks they were acquainted with</i>, and tells us, that the Doctor said in
his <i>last Illness</i>, to him<small><a name="f102.1" id="f102.1" href="#f102">[102]</a></small>, <i>that the merry way was that which he saw
mightily to take; and so he used it the more</i>.</p>

<p>The great and famous Sir <i>Thomas More</i>, Lord Chancellor of <i>England</i> in
<i>Henry</i> the Eighth&#8217;s time, was an inexhaustible Source of <i>Drollery</i><small><a name="f103.1" id="f103.1" href="#f103">[103]</a></small>,
as his voluminous Works, which consist for the most part of controversial
Divinity in behalf of Popery, show, and which are many of them written in
Dialogue, the better to introduce the <i>drolling</i> Way of Writing, which he
has us&#8217;d in such Perfection, that it is said <small><a name="f104.1" id="f104.1" href="#f104">[104]</a></small> <i>none can ever be weary
of reading them, tho they be never so long</i>. Nor could Death it self, in
immediate view before his Eyes, suppress his <i>merry</i> Humour, and hinder
him from cracking <i>Jests</i> on the <i>Scaffold</i>; tho he was a Man of great
<i>Piety</i> and <i>Devotion</i>, whereof all the World was convinced by his Conduct
both in his Life and at his Death.</p>

<p>It is said (as I have before observ&#8217;d) of my Lord Chancellor <i>Clarendon</i>,
that &#8220;he had too much <i>Levity</i> in his <i>Wit</i><small><a name="f105.1" id="f105.1" href="#f105">[105]</a></small>, and that he did not
always observe the <i>Decorum</i> of his Post.&#8221; Which implies not only his
Approbation of <i>Drollery</i> in the most <i>grave</i> Business, but also his great
Knowledge of Mankind, by applying to them in that <i>Way</i>; which he knew
from Experience, and especially from the common <i>drolling</i> <small><a name="f106.1" id="f106.1" href="#f106">[106]</a></small>
Conversation in the Court of King <i>Charles</i> the Second, would recommend
him to the World much more than an <i>impartial Administration of Justice</i>;
which is less felt, less understood, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>and less taken notice of and
applauded, than a <i>Piece</i> of <i>Wit</i>; which is generally suppos&#8217;d to imply
in it a great deal of Knowledge, and a Capacity fit for any thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Whiston</i><small><a name="f107.1" id="f107.1" href="#f107">[107]</a></small>, a famous Person among us, sets up for great <i>Gravity</i>,
and proposes a Scheme of <i>Gravity</i> for the Direction of those who write
about Religion: He is for allowing <i>Unbelievers</i>, nay for having them
&#8220;invited by Authority to produce all the real or original Evidence they
think they have discover&#8217;d against any Parts of the <i>Bible</i>; against any
Parts of the <i>Jewish</i> and Christian Religions, in order to their being
fully weigh&#8217;d and consider&#8217;d by all learned Men; provided at the same
time, that the whole be done <i>gravely</i>, and <i>seriously</i>, without all
<i>Levity</i>, <i>Banter</i>, and <i>Ridicule</i>.&#8221; And yet this Man, having a handle
given him by Bishop <i>Robinson</i>&#8217;s Letter to the <i>Clergy</i> of his <i>Diocess</i>
about <i>New Doxologies borrow&#8217;d from Old Hereticks</i>, takes the advantage of
the Bishop&#8217;s (supposed) Ignorance, Dulness, Stupidity, and Contradiction
to himself, and writes and prints, like a <i>Tom Brown</i> or <i>Swift</i>, a most
<i>bantering</i> and <i>drolling</i> Letter, under the sneering Title of a <i>Letter
of Thanks to the Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of</i> London, <i>for his late
Letter</i>, &amp;c. whom, one would think, he should not only have spar&#8217;d, but
have applauded for his <i>profound Gravity</i>, and carrying on the Cause of
Religion in a very remarkable manner, with the most <i>consummate
Solemnity</i>. But so strong was the Temptation, so naturally productive of
Mirth was the Bishop&#8217;s <i>Cause</i>, and his grave Management thereof, as that
he could not help laughing at the Bishop, by himself; and so was led on
mechanically to write in that Humour, and to publish what he wrote, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>afterwards to defend his drole
<i>Manner</i> <small><a name="f108.1" id="f108.1" href="#f108">[108]</a></small> of attacking the Bishop,
against those who took <i>offence</i> at that <i>Manner</i> of writing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XII. The burning Papists themselves are not always <i>serious</i> with us: They
treat the Church and its Defenders as <i>fanatical</i>, and <i>laugh</i> at them as
<i>such</i>, just as the Church does the Dissenters, and have their elaborate
Works of <i>Drollery</i> against their Adversaries. They publish&#8217;d a Poem
against the <i>Reformation</i>, just before the Death of Queen <i>Anne</i>, which
was design&#8217;d to have given such a Stroke to the Protestant Religion among
us, under the new projected Revolution, as <i>Hudibras</i> did to <i>Puritanism</i>
after the <i>Restoration</i>. The Popish Editor, in the Preface to the said
Poem, says, &#8220;that the Motive of the Author (<i>Thomas Ward</i>) for publishing
the <i>History of the Reformation in a Burlesque Style</i> (tho a History full
of melancholy Incidents, which have distracted the Nation, even beyond the
hope of recovery, after so much Blood drawn from all its Veins, and from
its Head) was that which he met with in Sir <i>Roger L&#8217;Estrange</i>&#8217;s Preface
to the second Part of his <i>Cit</i> and <i>Bumkin</i>, express&#8217;d in these Words;
<i>Tho this way of fooling is not my Talent, nor Inclination; yet I have
great Authorities for the taking up this Humour, in regard not only of the
Subject, but of the Age we live in; which is so much upon the Drole, that
hardly any thing else will down with it.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>And the ingenious Protestant Editor of this Poem at <i>London</i>, which he
allows to have some Wit in it, concludes the Remarks he makes upon it, by
saying, &#8220;One thing more we can&#8217;t forbear hinting at, that a Retaliation
would be as happy <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>a Thought as could enter into the Head of a Man of
Genius and Spirit. What a fruitful Harvest would the Legends, Tricks,
spiritual Jugglings, Convents, and Nunneries, yield to a good Poet?
<i>Buchanan</i> in his <i>Franciscani</i>, and <i>Oldham</i> in his <i>Satires</i> on the
Jesuits, have open&#8217;d the Way, and we heartily wish some equal Pen would
write the whole Mystery of Iniquity at length.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XIII. All the old Puritan Preachers, who were originally Divines of the
Church of <i>England</i>, sprinkled and season&#8217;d their Sermons with a great
many <i>drolling</i> Sayings against <i>Libertinism</i> and <i>Vice</i>, and against
Church Ceremonies; many of which Sayings are reported and handed down to
us in Books and Conversation, as are also the Effects of those Sayings,
which we are told converted many to <i>Christ</i> on the Spot, or in the
Instant of Delivery. Nor is that manner wholly laid aside, but has
continued to be kept alive by some Hands at all times; who have been
greatly follow&#8217;d for their Success in drolling upon <i>Sinners</i>, and
treating of Religion in humoursom and fantastical Phrases, and fixing that
way of Religion in some Mens Minds.</p>

<p>I do not remember to have met with a more complete Drole in the Church of
<i>England</i>, or in any other of the <i>laughing</i> or <i>ridiculing</i> Sects, than
<i>Andrew Marvel</i> of the grave <i>Puritan</i> Sect, in many Works of his both in
Prose and Verse, but especially in his <i>Rehearsal Transprosed</i>; which tho
writ against <i>Parker</i>, who with great Eloquence, Learning, and a Torrent
of Drollery and Satire, had defended the Court and Church&#8217;s Cause, in
asserting the Necessity of Penal Laws against the Nonconformists, &#8220;was
read from the <i>King</i> down to the Tradesman with great pleasure, on account
of that Burlesque Strain and lively Drollery that ran thro&#8217; it,&#8221;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> as
Bishop <i>Burnet</i> tells us<small><a name="f109.1" id="f109.1" href="#f109">[109]</a></small>. Nor were the gravest <i>Puritans</i> and
Dissenters among us less taken and pleas&#8217;d with his Writings for their
<i>Drollery</i>, than our <i>drole King</i>; tho there are some Passages in them,
which should give just Offence to chaste Ears.</p>

<p>I find also, that the <i>Puritans</i> and <i>Dissenters</i> have always born with,
and allow&#8217;d of, a great Mixture of <i>Drollery</i> in their Sermons, that one
would think should offend their Gravity, and pious Ears; and that they
applaud their Ministers for such their Discourses, as much as the Church
does Dr. <i>South</i> for the Ribaldry sprinkled thro&#8217;out his Sermons about the
most high Points in Divinity. They have always had some eminent Divines
among them who have been remarkable for such Passages and Reflections: And
these have never lessen&#8217;d their number of Auditors, nor drawn upon
themselves the Character of <i>Irreligious</i>; but have had the largest
Auditories of contributing Hearers, as well as of Churchmen, who came to
smile, and have been esteem&#8217;d very <i>pious</i> Men.</p>

<p>In fine, the <i>Puritans</i> and <i>Dissenters</i> have, like the Church, their
Taste of Humour, Irony, and Ridicule, which they promote with great Zeal,
as a Means to serve Religion: And I remember, that, among other things
said in behalf of <i>Bunyan</i>&#8217;s <i>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</i>, upon the reprinting it
lately by Subscription, it was affirm&#8217;d, and that, in my Opinion, truly,
&#8220;that it had infinitely out-done <i>The Tale of a Tub</i>; which perhaps had
not made one Convert to Infidelity, whereas the <i>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</i> had
converted many Sinners to <i>Christ</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XIV. The <i>Quakers</i> are certainly the most <i>serious</i> and solemn People
among us in Matters of Religion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> and out-go the Dissenters of all other
Kinds therein: But yet the Church has no regard to them on that Account,
but takes Advantage from thence to <i>ridicule</i> them the more, and to call
their Sincerity more in question. And I much doubt whether there was ever
a Book written against them by the Divines of any Sect with perfect
Decency, and that had not its extravagant Flouts, Scorn, Banter, and
Irony, and that not only of the <i>laughing</i>, but of the <i>cruel</i> kind:
Wherein they copy&#8217;d after the <i>Jews</i> of old, who while they prosecuted
<i>Christ</i> to Death, and carried on their High-Church Tragedy against him,
acted against him the <i>comick Scenes</i> <small><a name="f110.1" id="f110.1" href="#f110">[110]</a></small> &#8220;of spitting in his Face, and
buffeting him with the Palms of their Hands, saying, <i>Prophesy unto us,
thou Christ, who is he that smote thee</i>;&#8221; and who, when they had nail&#8217;d
him to the Cross, <i>revil&#8217;d</i> him with divers <i>Taunts</i>, in which the <i>Chief
Priests</i>, <i>Scribes</i>, <i>Elders</i>, and even the <i>Thieves, which were crucified
with him</i>, concurr&#8217;d. But yet for all this, these solemn Quakers
themselves are not altogether averse to <i>Irony</i> and <i>Ridicule</i>, and use it
when they can. Their Books abound in Stories to ridicule in their Turn the
Priests, their great and bitter Adversaries: And they please themselves
with throwing at the Priests the <i>Centuries of Scandalous Ministers</i>, and
the Books of the <i>Cobler of</i> Glocester. They have also their Satirist and
Banterer, <i>Samuel Fisher</i>; whose Works, tho all wrote in the <i>drolling</i>
Style and Manner, they pride themselves in, and have collected into one
great Volume in <i>Folio</i>; in which Quaker-Wit and Irony are set up against
Church, Presbyterian, and Independent Wit and Irony, without the least
Scruple of the lawfulness of such Arms. In a word, their Author acts the
Part of a <i>Jack-Pudding</i>, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span><i>Merry Andrew</i>, or <i>Buffoon</i>, with all the
seeming Right, Authority, and Privilege, of the Member of some Establish&#8217;d
Church of abusing all the World but themselves. The <i>Quakers</i> have also
encourag&#8217;d and publish&#8217;d a most arch Book of the famous <i>Henry Stubbe</i>,
intitled, <i>A Light shining out of Darkness</i>, &amp;c. Wherein all the other
religious Parties among us are as handsomly and learnedly banter&#8217;d and
ridicul&#8217;d, as the <i>Quakers</i> have been in any Book against them. And when
they were attack&#8217;d by one <i>Samuel Young</i>, a whimsical
Presbyterian-Buffoon-Divine, who call&#8217;d himself <i>Trepidantium Malleus</i>,
and set up for an Imitator of Mr. <i>Alsop</i>, in several Pamphlets full of
Stories, Repartees, and Ironies; in which <i>Young</i>, perhaps, thought
himself as secure from a Return of the like kind, as a Ruffian or Thief
may when he assaults Men: His Attacks were repell&#8217;d in a Book intitled
&#8220;<i>Trepidantium Malleus intrepidanter malleatus</i>; or the West Country
Wiseaker&#8217;s crack-brain&#8217;d <i>Reprimand</i> hammer&#8217;d about his own Numbscul.
Being a <i>Joco-satirical</i> Return to a late Tale of a Tub, emitted by a
reverend <i>Non-con</i>, at present residing not far from <i>Bedlam</i>,&#8221; said to be
written by <i>William Penn</i>, who has therein made use of the carnal Weapons
of Irony and Banter, and dress&#8217;d out the Presbyterian Priest in a Fool&#8217;s
Coat, for a Spectacle to the Mob. It is also to be observ&#8217;d, that there
are several Tracts in the two Volumes of <i>William Penn</i>&#8217;s Works lately
publish&#8217;d, that for ingenious Banter and Irony, are much superior to the
Priests his Adversaries; and that other Quaker Authors profess to write
sometimes in a <small><a name="f111.1" id="f111.1" href="#f111">[111]</a></small> <i>drolling Style</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XV. The Jacobite Clergy have set up for great <i>Droles</i> upon all the true
Friends of the <i>Establishment</i>. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>And I presume, the Body of our High
Churchmen would not willingly deprive them of the Benefit of their
<i>Drollery</i>.</p>

<p>The celebrated Mr. <i>Collier</i> <small><a name="f112.1" id="f112.1" href="#f112">[112]</a></small> thus attacks Bishop <i>Burnet</i>, for his
<span class="smcap">Essay</span> <i>on the Memory of Queen</i> Mary. &#8220;This Doctor, you know, is a Man of
mighty <i>Latitude</i>, and can say any thing to serve a Turn; whose
<i>Reverence</i> resolves Cases of Conscience backwards and forwards, disputes
<i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>, praises and dispraises by secular Measures; with whom
Virtue and Vice, passive Obedience and Rebellion, Parricide and filial
Duty, Treachery and Faithfulness, and all the Contradictions in Nature,
are the <i>best</i> and <i>worst</i> things under the Sun, as they are for his
Purpose, and according as the Wind sits: who equally and indifferently
writes for and against all Men, the Gospel, and himself too, as the World
goes: who can bestow a Panegyrick upon the seven deadly Sins, and (if
there be occasion) can make an Invective against all the Commandments.&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>In relation to Dr. <i>Payne</i>&#8217;s <i>Sermon</i> on the Death of that <i>Queen</i>, he
says<small><a name="f113.1" id="f113.1" href="#f113">[113]</a></small>, &#8220;that to go thro&#8217; it is too great a Discipline for any Man,
whose Palate hath ever relish&#8217;d any thing above <i>three half-penny
Poetry</i>.&#8221; He adds, &#8220;Why, Sir, many Years ago I have heard some of it sung
about the Streets in wretched and nauseous <i>Doggrel</i>. What think you of
this? <i>Page</i> 6. <i>I know not how to draw her Picture, &#8217;tis so all over
beauteous, without any Foil, any Shade, any Blemish; so perfect in every
Feature, so accomplish&#8217;d in every Part, so adorn&#8217;d with every Perfection
and every Grace.</i> O rare, Sir! here&#8217;s <i>Phillis</i> and <i>Chloris</i>, and <i>Gillian a Croydon</i>.</p>

<p class="poem"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
&#8220;<i>Sh&#8217; hath</i> every Feature, every Grace,<br />
&#8220;<i>So charming</i> every part, <i>&amp;c</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tis no wonder he tells us, (<i>p.</i> 8.) of <i>strewing her with the Flowers of
withered and decay&#8217;d Poetry</i>; for the <i>Song</i> out of which he hath
transcrib&#8217;d his <i>Sermon</i>, is of very <i>great age</i>, and hath been sung at
many a <i>Whitsun-Ale</i>, and many a <i>Wedding</i> (tho I believe never at a
Funeral before) and therefore in all this time may well be <i>decay&#8217;d and
wither&#8217;d</i>: In the mean time, if you were to draw the Picture of a <i>great
Princess</i>, I fansy you would not make choice of <i>Mopsa</i> to sit to it.
Alas! Sir, there was <i>Cassandra</i> and <i>Cleopatra</i>, and many a famed
<i>Romance</i> more, which might have furnish&#8217;d him with handsome Characters,
and yet he must needs be <i>preaching and instructing</i> his People out of
<i>Hey down derry</i>, and the <i>fair Maid of</i> Kent. If he had intitled it,
<i>The</i> White-Chapel <i>Ballad</i>, and got some body to set it to the Tune of
<i>Amaryllis</i>, compos&#8217;d by <i>W. P. Songster</i>, the Character of the <i>Author</i>,
the <i>Title</i>, and the <i>Matter</i>, would have very well agreed, and perhaps it
might have passed at the Corners of the Streets; but to call it a
<i>Sermon</i>, and by <i>W. P.</i> Doctor in <i>Divinity</i>, &#8217;tis one of the <i>lewdest</i>
things in the World.&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Lesley</i> attacks the Clergy, who pray&#8217;d &#8220;that God would give King
<i>James</i> Victory over all his Enemies<small><a name="f114.1" id="f114.1" href="#f114">[114]</a></small>, when that was the thing they
least wish&#8217;d; and confess&#8217;d, that they labour&#8217;d all they could against
it,&#8221; saying, &#8220;good God! What Apprehensions, what Thought had those Men of
their publick Prayers; bantering God Almighty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> and mocking him to his
Face, who heard their Words, and saw their Hearts? Is not <i>Atheism</i> a
smaller Sin than this, since it is better to have no God, than so to set up one <i>to laugh at him</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he says, (<i>p.</i> 123.) &#8220;It is a severe Jest, that the common People
have got up against the Clergy, that there was but one thing formerly
which the Parliament could not do, that is, to make a Man a Woman: But now
there is another, that is, to make an Oath which the Clergy will not take.&#8221;</p>

<p>The same Author attacks Bishop <i>Burnet</i>&#8217;s <i>Speech upon the Bill against
Occasional Conformity</i>, by a Pamphlet intitled, <i>The Bishop of</i>
Salisbury<i>&#8217;s proper Defence from a Speech cry&#8217;d about the Streets in his
Name, and said to have been spoken by him in the House of Lords upon the
Bill against Occasional Conformity</i>; which is one perpetual <i>Irony</i> on the
Bishop, and gives the Author occasion to throw all manner of Satire and
Abuse on the Bishop. The beginning of this Pamphlet, which is as follows,
will let the Reader into the full Knowledge of the Design of the Irony, and the manner of Execution.</p>

<p>&#8220;The License of this Age and of the Press is so great, that no Rank or
Quality of Men is free from the Insults of loose and extravagant Wits.</p>

<p>&#8220;The good Bishop of <i>Salisbury</i> has had a plentiful Share in this sort of
Treatment: And now at last, some or other has presum&#8217;d to burlesque his
Lordship in printing a Speech for him, which none that knows his Lordship can believe ever came from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But because it may go down with others who are too apt to take Slander
upon trust, and that his Lordship has already been pelted with several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Answers to his Speech, I have presum&#8217;d to offer the following
Considerations, to clear his Lordship from the Suspicion of having vented
(in such an august Assembly) those crude and undigested Matters which are
set forth in that Speech, and which so highly reflect on his Lordship&#8217;s self.&#8221;</p>

<p>He has taken the same Method of Irony to attack the said Bishop for his
<i>Speech</i> on the <i>Trial</i> of <i>Sacheverel</i>, and for a <i>Sermon</i>, under this
Title, &#8220;The Good Old Cause, <i>or</i> Lying in Truth; being a Second Defence of
the Lord Bishop of <i>Sarum</i> from a Second Speech, and also the Dissection
of a Sermon it is said his Lordship preach&#8217;d in the Cathedral Church of
<i>Salisbury</i>.&#8221; And this Pamphlet, which is also a continued Banter, begins thus.</p>

<p>&#8220;No Man has more deserv&#8217;d than this good Bishop, and no Man has been
more persecuted by various Ways and Means than his Lordship, even to
mobbing! But the ugliest and most malicious of all these Arts, is
that of putting false Things upon him; to write scandalous,
seditious, and senseless Papers, and to affix his Lordship&#8217;s Name! I
was forc&#8217;d some Years ago to vindicate his Lordship&#8217;s Reputation from
one of this sort: That Speech had a Bookseller&#8217;s Name to it of good
figure, and look&#8217;d something like; but this Speech (said likewise to
be spoken in the House of Lords) has no body to own it, and has all
the Marks of <i>Grub</i>. But the nasty Phiz is nothing to the inside. That discovers the Man; the Heart is false.&#8221;</p>

<p>This same Author has thought fit to attack Mr. <i>Hoadley</i> (since a Bishop)
in the way of Banter: His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> <i>Best Answer ever was made, and to which no
Answer will ever be made</i>, is by his own Confession a <i>Farce</i>; when he
says in his <i>Preface</i>, &#8220;If you ask why I treat this Subject by way of
<i>farce</i>, and shew a little Merriment sometimes? it was because the
Foundation you stand upon is not only <i>false</i> but <i>ridiculous</i>, and ought
to be treated with the <i>utmost Contempt</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again, in his &#8220;<i>Finishing Stroke, in defence of</i> his <i>Rehearsals, Best
Answer, and Best of all</i>,&#8221; he gives us (<i>p.</i> 125.) what he calls, &#8220;A
Battle-Royal between three Cocks of the Game, <i>Higden</i>, <i>Hoadley</i>, and a
<i>Hottentot</i>;&#8221; which in the <i>Contents</i> he calls <i>A Farce</i>, and to which he
joins both a <i>Prologue</i> and <i>Epilogue</i>, and divers other Particulars, all
taken from the <i>Play-house</i>.</p>

<p>The Reverend Mr. <i>Matthias Earbery</i> sets up for a great Satirist and Drole
upon the swearing and Low-Church Clergy, in numerous Pamphlets of late,
more particularly in his &#8220;<i>Serious Admonition to Dr.</i> Kennet: To which is
added, a short but complete Answer to Mr. <i>Marshal</i>&#8217;s late Treatise
called, <i>A Defence of our Constitution in Church and State</i>; and a
Parallel is drawn between him and Dr. <i>Kennet</i>, for the Satisfaction of
the unprejudic&#8217;d Reader.&#8221;</p>

<p>He has a bantering Argument <small><a name="f115.1" id="f115.1" href="#f115">[115]</a></small> to shew, that, &#8220;If in future Ages Mr.
<i>Marshal</i>&#8217;s Book should escape the just Judgment it deserves, of being
condemn&#8217;d to the <i>Pastry-Cooks</i> and <i>Grocers</i>, an industrious Chronologist
might make an Observation to prove him too young to write it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>Parallel</i> is in <i>Pag.</i> 126, which being very gross <i>Raillery</i>, I only
refer you to it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>This Mr. <i>Earbery</i> also wrote a <i>Letter to Bishop</i> Fleetwood, under the
Title of &#8220;A Letter to the Bishop of <i>Ely</i>, upon the Occasion of his
<i>suppos&#8217;d</i> late <i>Charge</i>, said to be deliver&#8217;d at <i>Cambridge August</i> 7,
1716, <i>&amp;c.</i>&#8221; in which he pursues the Ironical Scheme laid down in the said
Title, and endeavours to <i>vindicate</i> his <i>Lordship from the Aspersion of
writing such a mean Pamphlet</i>, as the <i>Charge</i>.</p>

<p>Nor do these <i>Jacobites</i> confine their Drollery to their Adversaries
without, but exercise it on one another, as may be seen in their late
Dispute about King <i>Edward the Sixth</i>&#8217;s Liturgy. And Mr. <i>Lesley</i> himself,
happening to engage on the side opposite to the Traditions of the Fathers,
and attacking those Traditions by Low-Church Notions and Arguments, and
thereby running counter to all his former Books, is attack&#8217;d just in the
same manner he attack&#8217;d Bishop <i>Burnet</i>, in a Book under this Title, &#8220;Mr.
<i>Lesley</i>&#8217;s Defence, from some erroneous and dangerous Principles, advanced
in a Letter said to have been written concerning the New Separation.&#8221; And
it has several Paragraphs at the beginning in the very words of one of Mr.
<i>Lesley</i>&#8217;s Books against the said Bishop, as may be seen on Comparison.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XVI. <i>Christ-Church</i> in <i>Oxford</i> is no less famous for the <i>Drolling</i>,
than for the <i>Orthodox</i> Spirit reigning there; and the former, being
judged an excellent Method to support the latter, is cultivated among the
Youth, and employ&#8217;d by the Members of that Society against all the
supposed Adversaries of the Church, and encourag&#8217;d by the governing
Ecclesiasticks there and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Among the many, who have receiv&#8217;d their Education there, and been form&#8217;d
in Drollery, I will only instance in the Reverend Dr. <i>Atterbury</i> and Dr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
<i>South</i>; who being as famous for <i>Drollery</i> as for Zeal for Religion, and
applauded for their <i>Wit</i> no less than for their <i>Orthodoxy</i>; and
particularly for imploying the former in behalf of the latter, seem of
sufficient Weight to bear down all Attempts to stifle their Productions.
What Considerations can make us amends for the Loss of such excellent
<i>drolling Writings</i>, which promote Religion as well as Mirth?</p>

<p>With what incomparable Mockery, Ridicule and Sarcasm does Dr. <i>Atterbury</i>
treat all the Low-Church Clergy that come in his way, together with the
<i>Whig</i> Ministry and Administration in his several <i>Convocational Tracts</i>?
Dr. <i>Wake</i>, our present Archbishop of <i>Canterbury</i>, is represented by him
as writing so <i>contumeliously</i> <small><a name="f116.1" id="f116.1" href="#f116">[116]</a></small> of the Clergy, <i>that had he not
inform&#8217;d us in his Title Page who he was, we should rather have guess&#8217;d
him to have been of the Cabal against Priests and Priestcraft, than one of
the Order</i>; and as wholly govern&#8217;d by <small><a name="f117.1" id="f117.1" href="#f117">[117]</a></small> <i>Interest</i> in the <i>Debate</i>,
and as giving us a most <small><a name="f118.1" id="f118.1" href="#f118">[118]</a></small> <i>shallow empty Performance</i> in relation to
our Ecclesiastical Constitution, which he <small><a name="f119.1" id="f119.1" href="#f119">[119]</a></small> <i>has done his best to
undermine</i>, as knowing himself to be in the wrong; and as <i>deserving</i> any
Name or Censure, none being <i>too bad to be bestow&#8217;d</i> on him; and in fine,
as <i>the least of the little officious Pens by which he expects to be traduc&#8217;d</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. <i>Bentley</i> is represented as <i>wrote out of Reputation into Preferment</i>;
which, whether it be a more severe Sarcasm on the Doctor, than on the
Government, is hard to determine; and besides, it gives Applause to one of
the most drolling and bantering Performances that this drolling Age has
produc&#8217;d, I mean <i>Dr.</i> Bentley<i>&#8217;s Dissertations on the Epistles of</i>
Phalaris, <i>and the Fables of</i> &AElig;sop, <i>examin&#8217;d</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>Bishop <i>Burnet</i> is a standing Subject of Ridicule with him; as are Bishop
<i>Nicholson</i>, Bishop <i>Kennet</i>, Bishop <i>Gibson</i>, Bishop <i>Trimnel</i> [to whom
he writes a most drolling <small><a name="f120.1" id="f120.1" href="#f120">[120]</a></small> Letter] and Dr. <i>West</i>; and all the
Topicks that can affect them as Scholars, as honest Men, and Clergymen,
are imploy&#8217;d to render them <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'ridiulons'">ridiculous</ins>, and set the World a laughing at
them, who are not in the least spar&#8217;d for their being of the Holy Order;
but on the contrary seem more loaded and baited with Sarcasms for that
reason.</p>

<p>For a <i>Specimen</i>, take this Banter or Burlesque upon Bishop <i>Kennet</i>&#8217;s
Dedication of his <i>Ecclesiastical Synods and Parliamentary Convocations</i>,
&amp;c. to the Archbishop of <i>Canterbury</i>; which Banter runs thus<small><a name="f121.1" id="f121.1" href="#f121">[121]</a></small>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">&#8220;<i>May it please your Grace</i>,</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. <i>Atterbury</i> has lately forc&#8217;d a Dedication upon you, which
favours too much of Presumption or Design; he has presum&#8217;d to
surprize you with an unexpected Address, and appears very indecently
before your Grace, because he has taken no care to express upon this
Subject a due Respect and Reverence to the Governors in Church and
State, such as is suitable to the Christian Religion, and his
particular Function: The Reports and Authorities in his Book are
Fruits of other Mens Collections, not the immediate Effects of his
own Searches into <i>Registers</i> and <i>Records</i>; he imperiously summons
your Grace and my Lords the Bishops to an immediate Compliance upon
pain of being pronounc&#8217;d Betrayers of the Church&mdash;&mdash;This, my Lord, is
the Character of the Person <i>I set up</i> against; but as for me, I <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>am
quite another sort of Man, I am very well bred, a great Antiquary,
beholden to no body, <i>some Wits and merry Folks call me a Tool and a
Play-thing</i> (<i>Pref. p.</i> 8.) But I assure your Grace, that what
Freedom soever I may have taken in taxing the Vices of the inferior
<i>Clergy</i>, (<i>p.</i> 77. 188.) and in reflecting <i>upon the ambitious
Designs of dignify&#8217;d Presbyters</i> (<i>p.</i> 196.); yet <i>I am however
tender and dutiful in treating the Governors of our Church</i> (p. 78.);
especially <i>those of them who are of the Ecclesiastical Commission
for Preferments</i>, (p. 311). I have a very great Respect and Reverence
for every body that will give me any thing; and how resolute soever
Mr. <i>Atterbury</i> may be, your Grace may do what you please with</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 6em;"><i>Your Grace&#8217;s most humble</i></span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>and obedient Servant</i>,</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 10em;">WHITE KENNET.</span></p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But for <i>Drollery</i>, the Reverend Dr. <i>South</i> outdoes even <i>Christ-Church</i>,
and fills all his Performances with it, and throws it out against the
Enemies of the Church, and in particular against the late Dr. <i>Sherlock</i>,
whom he thought fit to single out. I shall select some Passages from his
Writings against the said Doctor, which cannot but entertain the
High-Church Orthodox Reader, and reconcile him to a <i>Drollery</i> so well
employ&#8217;d.</p>

<p>He stiles him <i>a great good Man, as a certain poor Wretch</i>, meaning
<i>Prior, calls him</i>.</p>

<p>Again, he says<small><a name="f122.1" id="f122.1" href="#f122">[122]</a></small>, &#8220;There is hardly any one Subject which he (that is
Dr. <i>Sherlock</i>) has wrote upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> Popery excepted, that he has wrote both
for it and against it. Could any thing be more sharp and bitter against
the Dissenters than what this Man wrote in his <i>Answer</i> to the <i>Protestant
Reconciler</i>; and yet how frankly, or rather fulsomly does he open both his
Arms to embrace them in his Sermon preach&#8217;d before the Lord Mayor on
<i>November</i> 4, 1688. Tho I dare say, that the Dissenters themselves are of
that Constancy, as to own that they were of the same Principles in 88 that
they were of in 85; but the Truth is, old Friendships cannot be so easily
forgot: And it has been an Observation made by some, that hardly can any
one be found, who was first tainted with a Conventicle, whom a Cathedral
could ever after cure, but that still upon every cross turn of Affairs
against the <i>Church</i>, the irresistible <i>Magnetism</i> of the <i>Good Old Cause</i>
(as some still think it) would quickly draw him out of the <i>Good Old Way</i>.
The Fable tells us of a <i>Cat</i> once turn&#8217;d into a <i>Woman</i>, but the next
sight of a <i>Mouse</i> quickly dissolv&#8217;d the <i>Metamorphosis</i>, cashier&#8217;d the
Woman, and restor&#8217;d the Brute. And some <i>Virtuosi</i> (skill&#8217;d in the <i>useful
Philosophy</i> of <i>Alterations</i>) have thought her much a Gainer by the latter
Change, there being so many unlucky Turns in the World, in which it is not
half so safe and advantageous to <i>walk upright</i>, as to be <i>able to fall
always upon one&#8217;s Legs</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again, Dr. <i>South</i> says<small><a name="f123.1" id="f123.1" href="#f123">[123]</a></small>, &#8220;When I consider how wonderfully pleas&#8217;d the
Man is with these two new started Terms (<i>Self-consciousness</i> and <i>mutual
Consciousness</i>) so high in Sound and so empty of Sense, instead of one
substantial word (<i>Omniscience</i>)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> which gives us all that can be pretended
useful in them, with vast Overplus and Advantage, and even swallows them
up, as <i>Moses</i>&#8217;s Rod did those pitiful Tools of the <i>Magicians</i>: This (I
say) brings to my mind (whether I will or no) a certain Story of a grave
Person, who riding in the Road with his Servant, and finding himself
something uneasy in his Saddle, bespoke his Servant thus: <i>John</i> (says he)
<i>alight, and first take off the Saddle that is upon my Horse, and then
take off the Saddle that is upon your Horse; and when you have done this,
put the Saddle that was upon my Horse, upon your Horse; and put the Saddle
that was upon your Horse, upon my Horse</i>. Whereupon the Man, who had not
studied the Philosophy of Saddles (whether <i>Ambling</i> or <i>Trotting</i>) so
exactly as his Master, replies something short upon him; <i>Lord, Master,
what need all these words? Could you not as well have said, Let us change
Saddles?</i> Now I must confess, I think the Servant was much in the right;
tho the Master having a <i>rational Head of his own</i>, and being withal
willing to make the <i>Notion</i> of <i>changing</i> Saddles more <i>plain</i>, <i>easy</i>
and <i>intelligible</i>, and to give a clearer Explication of that word (which
his Forefathers, how good <i>Horsemen</i> soever they might have been, yet were
<i>not equally happy in explaining of</i>) was pleas&#8217;d to set it forth by that
more full and accurate Circumlocution.&#8221;</p>

<p>He says<small><a name="f124.1" id="f124.1" href="#f124">[124]</a></small>, <i>The Author</i>, Dr. <i>Sherlock, is no doubt a</i> Grecian <i>in his
Heart</i>! And the tenth Chapter of the <i>Animadversions</i> is one continued
Banter upon the <i>Dean</i> for his Ignorance in <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i>, and even
his Inability to spell: All which he <i>closes</i> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>with saying, &#8220;That St.
<i>Paul</i>&#8217;s <i>School</i> is certainly an excellent School, and St. <i>Paul</i>&#8217;s
Church a most noble Church; and therefore he thinks that he directs his
Course very prudently, and happily too, who in his Passage to such a
<i>Cathedral</i>, takes a School in his way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again, he says<small><a name="f125.1" id="f125.1" href="#f125">[125]</a></small>, &#8220;He cannot see any new Advantage that the Dean has
got over the <i>Socinians</i>, unless it be, that the Dean thinks his <i>three
Gods</i> will be too hard for their <i>one</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>After citing several Scurrilities of the Dean<small><a name="f126.1" id="f126.1" href="#f126">[126]</a></small>, (who it must be
confess&#8217;d, appears therein a great Banterer also of Dr. <i>South</i> and his
Performance) the Dr. says, &#8220;These, with several more of the like
<i>Gravel-Lane</i> Elegancies, are all of them such peculiar Strictures of the
Dean&#8217;s <i>Genius</i>, that he might very well spare his Name, where he had made
himself so well known by his Mark; for all the foregoing
<i>Oyster-Wive-Kennel-Rhetorick</i> seems so naturally to flow from him, who
had been so long Rector of St. <i>Botolph</i> (with the well-spoken
<i>Billingsgate</i> under his Care) that (as much a Teacher as he was) it may
well be question&#8217;d, whether he has learn&#8217;d more from his Parish, than his
Parish from him.&mdash;All favours of the Porter, the Carman, and the Waterman;
and a pleasant Scene it must be to see the <i>Master of the Temple</i> laying
about him in the Language of the Stairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>To the Dean&#8217;s Scoff, that <i>this Argument</i>, &amp;c. <i>was worth its weight in
Gold, tho the</i> Dean <i>fears it will not much enrich the Buyer</i>, the Doctor
replies<small><a name="f127.1" id="f127.1" href="#f127">[127]</a></small>, &#8220;What is that to him? Let him mind his own Markets, who
never writes to <i>enrich the Buyer</i> but the Seller;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> and that <i>Seller</i> is
himself: and since he is so, well is it for his Books and his Bookseller
too, that Men generally <i>buy</i> before they <i>read</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>In requital of the scurrilous Character of an <i>ingenious Blunderer</i>, Dr.
<i>South</i> says<small><a name="f128.1" id="f128.1" href="#f128">[128]</a></small>, &#8220;He must here return upon him the just Charge of an
<i>impious Blasphemer</i>, and that upon more Accounts than one; telling him
withal, that had he liv&#8217;d in the former Times of the Church, his Gown
would have been stript off his Back for his detestable Blasphemies and
Heresies, and some other Place found out for him to perch in than the Top
of St. <i>Paul&#8217;s</i>, where at present he is placed like a true Church
Weather-Cock, (as he is) notable for nothing so much, as <i>standing high and turning round</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again, he says<small><a name="f129.1" id="f129.1" href="#f129">[129]</a></small>, &#8220;And so I take my leave of the Dean&#8217;s <i>three distinct
infinite Minds, Spirits</i>, or <i>Substances</i>, that is to say, of his <i>three
Gods</i>; and having done this, methinks I see him go whimpering away with
his Finger in his Eye, and the Complaint of <i>Micah</i> in his Mouth, <i>Ye have
taken away my Gods which I made, and what have I more</i><small><a name="f130.1" id="f130.1" href="#f130">[130]</a></small>? Tho he must
confess, he cannot tell why he should be so fond of them, since he dares
undertake that he will never be able to bring the Christian World either
to believe in, or to worship a <i>Trinity of Gods</i>: Nor does he see what use
they are likely to be of, even to himself, unless peradventure to <i>swear by</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again, the Doctor says<small><a name="f131.1" id="f131.1" href="#f131">[131]</a></small>, &#8220;The Dean&#8217;s following Instruction to his
Friend is certainly very diverting, in these words, where the Animadverter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>charges the Dean with Absurdities and Contradictions; turn to the Place
and read it with its Context, and tell me what you cannot answer, and I
will; to which he would have done well to have added, <i>If I can</i>. But the
whole Passage is just as if he had said, Sir, if you find not
Contradictions and Absurdities enough in my Book to satisfy your Curiosity
that way, pray come to the Fountain-head, and consult me, and you shall be
sure of a more plentiful Supply.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again, upon the Dean&#8217;s &#8220;Frequent reproaching the <small><a name="f132.1" id="f132.1" href="#f132">[132]</a></small> Animadverter with
the Character of a <i>Wit</i>, tho join&#8217;d with such ill-favour&#8217;d Epithets, as
his witless Malice has thought fit to degrade it with, as that he is <i>a
spiteful Wit</i>, a <i>wrangling Wit</i>, a <i>satirical Wit</i>, and the <span class="smcap">Witty</span>,
<i>subtle</i>, <i>good-natur&#8217;d Animadverter, &amp;c.</i> the Dr. says, that tho there be
but little <i>Wit</i> shewn in making such Charges; yet if <i>Wit</i> be a
<i>Reproach</i> (be it of what sort it will) the Animadverter is too <i>just</i> to
return this <i>Reproach</i> upon the <i>Defender</i>; and withal, understands
himself, and what becomes him, too well, either to <i>assume</i> to himself, or
so much as to <i>admit</i> the Character of a <i>Wit</i>, as at all due to him;
especially since he knows that <i>common Sense</i> (a thing much short of Wit)
is enough to enable him to deal with such an Adversary. Nevertheless,
there are many in the World, who are both call&#8217;d and accounted <i>Wits</i>, and
really are so; which (one would think) should derive something of Credit
upon this Qualification, even in the Esteem of this Author himself, or at
least rebate the Edge of his Invectives against it, considering that it
might have pleas&#8217;d God to have made him a <i>Wit</i> too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>XVII. As things now stand, it may easily be seen, that Prosecutions for
<i>Raillery</i> and <i>Irony</i> would not be relish&#8217;d well by the Publick, and
would probably turn to the Disreputation and Disgrace of the Prosecutor.</p>

<p>Archbishop <i>Laud</i> has always been much censur&#8217;d for his malicious
Prosecution of <i>Williams</i> in the <i>Star-Chamber</i>; among whose Crimes I find
the following laid to his Charge: <small><a name="f133.1" id="f133.1" href="#f133">[133]</a></small> <i>That he said all Flesh in</i>
England <i>had corrupted their Ways</i>; that <i>he call&#8217;d a Book intitled</i>, A
Coal from the Altar (written by Dr. <i>Heylin</i>, for placing the
Communion-Table at the East-end of the Church, and railing it in) <i>a
Pamphlet</i>; that he <i>scoffingly said, that he had heard of a Mother Church,
but not of a Mother Chapel, meaning the King&#8217;s, to which all Churches in
Ceremony ought to conform</i>; that <i>he wickedly jested on St.</i> Martin<i>&#8217;s
Hood</i>; that <i>he said the People ought not to be lash&#8217;d by every body&#8217;s
Whip</i>; that <i>he said</i>, (citing <i>a National Council for it</i>) <i>that the
People are God&#8217;s and the King&#8217;s, and not the Priest&#8217;s People; and that he
doth not allow Priests to jeer and make Invectives against the People</i>.
And I humbly conceive, that such Matters had much better be suffer&#8217;d to go
on in the World, and take their Course, than that Courts of Judicature
should be employ&#8217;d about them. A Sentence that imply&#8217;d some <i>Clergymen</i>
corrupt, as well as some <i>Laymen</i>, of whom <i>Laud</i> would only allow to have
it said, that they had <i>corrupted their Ways</i>; a <i>Jest</i> upon St.
<i>Martin</i>&#8217;s <i>Hood</i>, which, according to Ecclesiastical History, <i>cur&#8217;d sore
Eyes</i>; and a <i>Ridicule</i> upon a High-Church Book of <i>Heylin</i>&#8217;s, by calling
it a Pamphlet, tho it was really a Pamphlet, as consisting of but seventy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>Pages in Quarto; seem less <i>wicked</i> and hurtful than disturbing, fining,
and undoing Men about them. And the having some Concern for the People,
that they should not be used as the Priest pleas&#8217;d; that the <i>People</i>
belong to <i>God</i> and the <i>King</i>, and <i>not to the Priest</i>; and the <i>not
allowing</i> the <i>Priests</i> to <i>jeer and make Invectives against the People</i>;
seem all Errors fit to be born with.</p>

<p>Archbishop <i>Laud</i> was also thought guilty of an excessive Piece of
Weakness in the Punishment of <small><a name="f134.1" id="f134.1" href="#f134">[134]</a></small> <i>Archibald</i> the King&#8217;s Fool, by laying
the Matter before the Privy-Council, and occasioning him to be expell&#8217;d
the King&#8217;s House for a poor <i>Jest</i> upon himself; who, as he was a Man at
the Head of the State, should have despis&#8217;d such a thing in any Body, much
more in a <i>Fool</i>, and who should never have been hurried on to be the
Instrument of any <i>Motion</i> against him, but have left it to others; who
upon the least Intimation would have been glad to make their court to
<i>Laud</i>, by sacrificing a <i>Fool</i> only to his Resentment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XVIII. I could have entertain&#8217;d the Reader with a great Variety of
Passages out of the Fathers of the Church, whose Writings are Magazines of
Authority, and urg&#8217;d upon us upon all Occasions by Ecclesiasticks, and are
particularly full of <i>Burlesque</i> and <i>Ridicule</i> on the <i>Gods and Religion</i>
of the <i>Pagans</i>; in the use whereof they are much more unanimous, than in
the Articles of their <i>Creed</i>. But that being a Subject too great and
extensive for a Digression, I shall content my self with the few following
Reflections; which will sufficiently evince, that the <i>Taste</i> of the
Primitive Christians was like that of the rest <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>of the World; that they
could laugh and be as merry as the <i>Greeks</i> and other <i>Pagans</i>; and that
they would take the Advantage of the <i>Pagans</i> weak Cause, to introduce
<i>Ridicule</i>, which always bears hard upon Weakness and Folly, and must load
them so as to prevent a Possibility of their being remov&#8217;d by another
<i>Ridicule</i>.</p>

<p>These Fathers have transfused into their Writings all the Wit and Raillery
of the antient <i>Pagan</i> Writers and Philosophers; who it is well known
wrote a great deal to turn <i>Paganism</i> into Ridicule; most of which now
exists no where but in the Works of the Fathers; all Books of that kind
being lost, except <i>Cicero</i>&#8217;s Books of <i>the Nature of Gods</i>, and of
<i>Divination</i>, and the Dialogues of <i>Lucian</i>; both which Authors have been
of great use to the <i>Fathers</i> to set them up for <i>Wits</i>, <i>Droles</i>, and
<i>Satirists</i>. For a Specimen how well these antient <i>Pagans</i> could <i>drole</i>,
and how much beholden we are to the Fathers for recording their
Drolleries, the most remarkable, I think, are some <i>Fragments</i> of a Book
of <i>Oenomaus</i> concerning the <i>Pagan Oracles</i>, cited and preserv&#8217;d by <small><a name="f135.1" id="f135.1" href="#f135">[135]</a></small>
<i>Eusebius</i>; who has given us occasion to <small><a name="f136.1" id="f136.1" href="#f136">[136]</a></small> <i>regret</i> the loss of this
Work, as one of the most valuable Books written by the Antients on the
Subject of <i>Oracles</i>, tho those Books were <i>very numerous</i>. And it is to
be observ&#8217;d, that this Book and a great many, perhaps a <small><a name="f137.1" id="f137.1" href="#f137">[137]</a></small> thousand
more, were publish&#8217;d in <i>Greece</i>, where the Imposture of <i>Oracles</i> greatly
prevail&#8217;d, and great Wealth flow&#8217;d in, not only to the Priests of the
<i>Oracular Temples</i>, but to all the Inhabitants of <i>Greece</i>, and especially
to those who lived in the Neighbourhood of the several <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span><i>Oracular
Temples</i>; who made a great Profit from the rich Travellers, that came from
all Parts of the World to know their Fortunes. This shews the great
Integrity and Fairness of the old <i>Pagans</i>; who would suffer not only
their supposed standing Revelation to be call&#8217;d in <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'qustion'">question</ins>, but a
Revelation that brought in as much Money, as the Chapels, Churches, and
Shrines dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, or to any of the Saints, do in
the <i>Roman</i> Church, without calling any Man to Account for the Liberties
they took; who, as far as appears, were not expos&#8217;d <small><a name="f138.1" id="f138.1" href="#f138">[138]</a></small> <i>to any Danger</i>
thereby. It is also to be observ&#8217;d, that the merry <small><a name="f139.1" id="f139.1" href="#f139">[139]</a></small> <i>Epicureans were
none of them ever prosecuted</i>, and <i>that</i> Epicurus <i>himself died quietly
at</i> Athens <i>in a very great old Age</i>.</p>

<p>But the Book, which the Fathers made the most use of, was that arch, fly,
and drolling Performance, now lost, of <i>Evemerus</i>, which he intitled, <i>A
sacred History</i>: wherein he gave an <i>historical Account</i> of the <i>Birth</i>,
<i>Country</i>, <i>Lives</i>, <i>Deaths</i>, and <i>Burials</i> of the <i>Gods</i>. This Work was
translated into <i>Latin</i> by that arch Wag <i>Ennius</i>, who himself has most
ingeniously <i>ridicul&#8217;d</i> several Impostors or very grave Persons, in a
remarkable Piece of Poetry, which I shall give my Reader in <i>English</i>.</p>

<p class="poem">
&#8220;<i>I value not a Rush the</i> Marsian <i>Augur,</i><br />
&#8220;<i>Nor Country-Fortune Tellers, nor Town-Star-Gazers,</i><br />
&#8220;<i>Nor jugling Gypsies, nor yet Dream-Interpreters:</i><br />
&#8220;<i>For, not by Skill or Art, are these Diviners;</i><br />
&#8220;<i>But superstitious Prophets, Guessers impudent,</i><br />
&#8220;<i>Or idle Rogues, or craz&#8217;d, or mere starving Beggars.</i><br />
&#8220;<i>They know no way themselves, yet others would direct;</i><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>XIX. Wherefore I cannot but presume, that an Attempt to make a <i>Law</i> to
restrain <i>Irony</i>, &amp;c. would prove abortive, and that the Attempt would be
deem&#8217;d the Effect of a very partial Consideration of things, and of
present Anger at a poor Jest; which Men are not able to bear themselves,
how much soever they abound in <i>Jests</i>, both of the <i>light</i> and <i>cruel</i>
kind, on others: tho for my own part I concur heartily with you in
<i>making</i> such a <i>Law</i>, and in leaving it to a Person of your <i>Equity</i> to
draw it up, craving only the Liberty to propose an Amendment or Addition,
<i>viz.</i> that you would be pleas&#8217;d to insert a Clause to prevent <i>Irony</i>,
<i>Ridicule</i>, and <i>Banter</i>, from invading the Pulpit, and particularly to
prevent pointing out <i>Persons of Men</i> <small><a name="f140.1" id="f140.1" href="#f140">[140]</a></small> from thence, and reviling
them, as also reviling whole Bodies of Men: For whatever is immoral in
Print, is, in my Opinion, immoral in the Pulpit. Besides, these things
seem more improper in the Pulpit, than they can be in Print: because no
<i>Reprisals</i> can be made in the former, as in the latter Case; where they,
or the Fear of them, may give some Check to the Disorder, and reduce
things to a tolerable Temper and Decency. If, in order to justify my
Motion, it could be thought necessary or proper here to give a Detail of
ridiculing and ironical Passages, taken from Sermons against particular
Men, and Bodies of Men, and their Doctrines, you cannot but know how easy
it would be to fill a Volume with them, without going to Authors, who have
occasionally produc&#8217;d abundance of them. And I will only mention here a
Passage in a <i>Volume of Sermons</i>, just now publish&#8217;d, of a well known
<i>High Divine</i>, the Reverend Mr. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span><i>William Reeves</i>, made famous by his
<i>Translation</i> of some <i>Apologies of the Primitive Fathers</i>, which gain&#8217;d
him the Applauses of a great many <i>High Men</i>, and particularly <i>Hickes</i>,
<i>Dodwel</i>, and <i>Nelson</i>, &amp;c. and a Recommendation from the last to the
Queen, who in the latter end of her Reign made him <i>Chaplain in Ordinary</i>,
and obtain&#8217;d for him a considerable Preferment. This Gentleman, attacking
Bishop <i>Hoadley</i>&#8217;s <i>Sermon</i> of <i>The Kingdom of Christ</i>, says<small><a name="f141.1" id="f141.1" href="#f141">[141]</a></small>, &#8220;In
these last Days we have been taught to be as indolent and unconcern&#8217;d as
possible in the Service of God: A noted <i>Novellist</i> [Bp. <i>Hoadley</i>] among
many other odd <i>Engines</i>, hath invented one, to pump out all Devotion from
Prayer, and make it a <i>Vacuum</i>. Instead of the old fervent, affectionate
way of Worshipping, he hath substituted a new Idol, a Vanity, a Nothing of
his own, <i>a calm and undisturb&#8217;d Address to God</i>.&mdash;&mdash;The <i>Arrows</i> and
<i>bitter Words</i> Mr. <i>Hales</i> hath levell&#8217;d against <i>Rome</i> only, our Right
Reverend hath <i>pointed a-new</i>, and shot them full against the Church he
superintends, and with all the Force of inbred, fanatick Fury. And by this
time surely it is well known, that he is a very <i>warm Man</i> in every thing,
but his <i>Prayers</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XX. Instead of addressing the foregoing Papers to you, I could have
address&#8217;d them to several others; who of late have thought fit to
recognize the Right of Men, to examine into, and judge for themselves in
all Matters of speculation, and especially in Matters of mere Religion,
and to publish their Reasons against any Opinions they judge erroneous,
tho publickly receiv&#8217;d in the Country where they live, provided they do it
<i>seriously</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> and <i>gravely</i>: which is a noble Progress in Truth, and owing
to that glorious Liberty, and Freedom of Debate, that we enjoy under our
most excellent Princes; and which extorts it even from them, who, to have
some Credit in the World, are forced to own, what would discredit them to
go on to deny, among all who have any degree of <i>Virtue</i>, <i>Sense</i>, and
<i>Learning</i>. But I was determin&#8217;d to address my self to you, as a Person of
more remarkable <i>Moderation</i> than ordinary in your <i>Letter</i> to Dr.
<i>Rogers</i>: And one, who had, long before, in your <i>Defence of the
Constitution in Church and State; in answer to the Charge of the
Nonjurors, accusing us of Heresy and Schism, Perjury and Treason</i>, &#8220;valu&#8217;d
<small><a name="f142.1" id="f142.1" href="#f142">[142]</a></small> and commended the Integrity of the Nonjurors in declaring their
Sentiments:&#8221; and who, tho you justly charge those of them you write
against, &#8220;as attacking us with such uncommon Marks of Violence <small><a name="f143.1" id="f143.1" href="#f143">[143]</a></small> as
most plainly intimate, that no Measures are intended to be kept with us by
them in the Day of their Prosperity, who in the Day of their Adversity,
even when they are most at Mercy, cannot refrain from such <i>raging</i>
Provocations; but when reduced to the Necessity of <i>taking</i> Quarter,
profess most plainly they will never give it:&#8221; Yet as to these Enemies,
who would destroy our Church and State, and <small><a name="f144.1" id="f144.1" href="#f144">[144]</a></small> &#8220;revive upon us the
Charge of <i>Heresy</i> and <i>Schism</i>, <i>Perjury</i> and <i>Treason</i>, Crimes of no
small figure either in the Law or in the Gospel,&#8221; you only say, that &#8220;if
you may have leave to borrow a Thought from <small><a name="f145.1" id="f145.1" href="#f145">[145]</a></small> one of their own most
celebrated Writers, you would tell them, that <i>the Blood and Spirits were
made to rise upon such Occasions</i>: Nature design&#8217;d not, that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>we should be
cold or indifferent in our manner of receiving, or returning, such foul
Reproaches.&#8221; This is great Moderation, and such as I heartily approve,
being dispos&#8217;d to forgive the Punishment due by Law to any Fault, when the
Non-execution of it will not overturn the Government. And I am willing to
hope, that since you can think that such bitter Adversaries to you, as
these licentious <i>Jacobites</i> are, should only be smartly replied to, and
not be prosecuted by the Government, you will, upon Reflection, think,
that a merry, good humour&#8217;d Adversary should be treated as well.</p>

<p>Tho I have endeavour&#8217;d to defend the Use of <i>Ridicule</i> and <i>Irony</i>, yet it
is such <i>Irony</i> and <i>Ridicule</i> only as is fit for polite Persons to use.
As to the gross <i>Irony</i> and <i>Ridicule</i>, I disapprove of it, as I do other
Faults in Writing; only I would not have Men punish&#8217;d, or any other way
disturb&#8217;d about it, than by a Return of <i>Ridicule</i> and <i>Irony</i>. This I
think fit to conclude with, more to prevent Misrepresentation from others,
than from you; whom I look on to have too much Sense and Integrity to
mistake or misrepresent me.</p>
